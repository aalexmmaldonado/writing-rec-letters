== Introduction

Despite the numerous pronoun errors in the above quote, its message does speak to me as a reader of recommendation letters.
I’ve read many letters that are brimming with words yet somehow vacant of content.

Consider these bloated sentences:

#quote()[
  It is with distinct and sincere pleasure that I come to recommend this candidate for the desired opportunity.
]

#quote()[
  He is an excellent student with stellar grades and one who has achieved the highest rankings.
]


The first example is so self-important that it’s almost silly, while the second manages to say the same thing three times but with no specifics. Unfortunately, such sentences are the norm in many recommendation letters. Readers of such letters find themselves begging for content. They want substance rather than puffery, especially in a recommendation letter, which should only have to be read once and should give us an individual snapshot of the candidate.

To help you create such a snapshot, this chapter discusses proven ways to generate content and provide examples and evidence in recommendation letters. Just as important is to consider the circumstances that influence the writing of the letter, and to provide relevant detail.

In writing an effective letter, perhaps it will help you to heed the same advice that I give to students when they’re writing a cover letter for a job—try to think of the document as an argument. You’re actually positing a premise followed by examples and evidence designed to lead the audience to a desired conclusion. Also, as in a cover letter, you’re working within an existing framework where efficiency and professionalism are expected, and where the goal is to produce a document with enough individuality that no one else could have written its particulars. Fill your letters with content accordingly.

/*


As a beginning independent investigator, chances are you will soon have to write
a letter of recommendation on behalf of a student, a postdoc, or even a colleague.
Your job as letter writer will be to describe the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses as they relate to the position or program in a way that is both thoughtful
and personal. A letter that falls short of this goal will be of little value to those
evaluating applications and will not help the candidate get what he or she is after.
So, it pays to put in the necessary effort and time to write a “good” letter. This
chapter provides insights and advice from experienced investigators on how to
do so. It is not meant to be prescriptive but rather to offer some suggestions from
which you can pick and choose.
BEING ASKED TO WRITE A LETTER
Letters of recommendation are ubiquitous in an academic research career. If
you teach one or more senior-level undergraduate courses or have undergraduate
students in your laboratory, you might have to write dozens of letters a year as
students become graduate-school bound or look for employment. If you do not
teach undergraduates and have primarily graduate students and postdocs in your
lab, you will have significantly fewer letters to write—maybe for only one or two
people each year.
In addition to the people in your own lab, graduate students and postdocs in
your department may ask you to write letters for them when they apply for fellowships or seek new positions. Colleagues might also ask you to write letters of
recommendation on their behalf for various promotions or awards, but that may
not happen too often until you are more established.
For Whom Should You Write?
As a mentor, you have an obligation to support students and postdocs in your lab
in their job search and to help them find a good match for their abilities and aspirations. If they ask you to write a recommendation letter, it is customary to support them in this way. The best thing to do is to sit down with them and discuss
their plans before they start applying for jobs. If their career goals are unrealistic,
talk about what they need to do to become more competitive or help steer them 
in a different direction. If you do end up writing a letter for someone in your lab
for a job you don’t think is a good fit, there are ways to put a positive spin on the
negative (see page 6, “Writing a ‘Not-So-Enthusiastic’ Letter”). If people who are
not part of your lab ask you to write a letter for them, it is up to you to decide
whether to do so.
Reasons to Turn Someone Down
You should write a letter of recommendation only if you can honestly write a
supportive letter for someone for a given position. After all, a letter of recommendation is supposed to be a tool for helping people obtain what they are after.
If you don’t know the candidate well enough to write a good letter, let the person
know. He or she will probably ask someone else.
If you do know the candidate well but have some reservations, let the person
know about your concerns, and leave it up to him or her to decide whether you
should still write the letter. 


PREPARATION
Read Some Sample Letters
If you have never written a letter of recommendation before, read a stack of
reference letters to see what works and what doesn’t. Most faculty have access to
graduate student applications and the letters submitted. Junior faculty can also
ask their more experienced colleagues to share “sample” letters they have written
or have received from applicants (blocking out names and other personal information). The resource section of this chapter provides links to sample letters.
Collect Information
Once you know what a letter of recommendation looks like, make sure you find
out as much as possible about the candidate for whom you are writing. One of
the worst things you can do is to write a letter that is too generic.
Ask for the following information:
♦ For people in your lab—you probably already have a current curriculum vitae (CV), but also ask for as
complete a description as possible of
the position or program for which
the person is applying. 
♦ For people who are not in your lab—ask for a current CV that includes
the dates and locations of their training and a list of publications as well
as copies of any papers that are in press or that have been submitted.
♦ For people who were in your lab but have since moved on—ask for a
written summary of their current work, future plans, and why they are
interested in the position for which you are writing the letter.
♦ For students who are not in your lab or department but who were in one
of the classes you taught—ask for transcripts and check your class records.
Many reference writers find it helpful to meet with the person who has requested
the letter of recommendation. In such a meeting you can learn about the person’s
long-term career goals and how his or her current research and other activities relate to these goals. Ask about the programs
or positions for which letters are being
requested and what the individual’s preference is and why. You should also discuss
the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses
as they relate to these positions.
If you cannot have a face-to-face meeting,
ask the candidate for a detailed written
description of these issues.

Allot Sufficient Time to Write and Send the Letter
Once you have gathered the data and marked the deadline on your calendar,
make sure you set aside enough time to write the letter. It can take one to two
hours, sometimes longer, to craft a well-written letter for one individual. (It takes
less time to tweak this initial letter for different programs or positions the same
individual has applied to.)
The candidate should give you clear instructions on how and where to send the
letter. Some letters have to be submitted online, some e-mailed, and others sent
by snail mail. 

WHAT THE LETTER SHOULD SAY
Keep the following pointers in mind when you craft your letter.
Introduce Yourself and the Candidate
Begin the letter by describing how you know the candidate. Briefly state your
own qualifications so that people who don’t know you can decide whether to trust your judgment. But don’t go overboard and make the letter about yourself!
For example, “During my years of training as a postdoc and now as a faculty
member, I have worked with and personally trained more than xx graduate
students in laboratories at the University of Michigan, Harvard Medical School,
and, currently, at Emory University. In my opinion, candidate x is among the
top 5 percent of the graduate students I have known.” (You may want to include
students you trained as a postdoc, if you have not yet had many students in your
own lab.)

Present the Candidate Truthfully but Positively
Devote several paragraphs to discussing the candidate’s scientific work and
personality, following the suggestions below.
Be specific. Give meaningful examples of achievements and provide stories or
anecdotes that illustrate the candidate’s strengths. Don’t just praise by using generalities (such as “quick learner”), but say what the candidate did to give you that
impression. These details will show you have a strong relationship and also bring
the candidate alive on the page. If the candidate works in your laboratory, make
sure the letter talks about his or her specific contributions to the lab’s research.
♦ “Student x is the first person to successfully master in vivo imaging in my
laboratory and did all the trouble-shooting calibration and testing completely independently.”
♦ “Student x is the first student in my lab to have a first-author Cell paper.
She contributed data for five of the figures and made an important
intellectual contribution to the experimental design and to writing the
discussion.”
♦ “Candidate x’s research was submitted as an abstract and was accepted for
a podium presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research
national meeting earlier this year. Although she is an undergraduate student,
I treated candidate x in the same manner
I would treat an experienced graduate
student by having her prepare and present
the talk independently. At the meeting,
she presented the work and answered all
the questions from the audience in a clear
and professional manner. After the talk
several scientists came up to express how impressed they were with the
presentation.”


You don’t just have to describe the candidate as he or she is right now—you can
discuss the development the person has undergone.
♦ “When candidate x came to the lab he showed promise but was not able
to plan experiments effectively. Through his own hard work he has acquired this skill and has become an excellent scientist.”
Quantify and compare. Find a way to quantify the candidate’s abilities, especially with respect to other scientists who have achieved success in the field and
who the letter reader might know. Many letter writers rank the applicants according to their own measure of what makes a good researcher, graduate student, or
technician. Depending on the position, most people rank candidates according to
a combination of research strength, leadership skills, writing ability, oral communication, teaching ability, and collegiality.
♦ “There are currently 17 graduate students in our department and I rank
candidate x as 4/17. Her bench skills are the best I have ever had in my
own lab, but she still needs to develop better communication skills.”
Address the requirements of the position. Make sure the letter discusses the
most important skills and personality traits needed for success in the job.
♦ “I understand that you are looking for a person who will be able to establish a program to study nuclear structure and architecture using imaging
technologies. Candidate x has performed similar studies using fluorescent
imaging in living cells. Her mastery of these experimental techniques is
demonstrated by her recent first-author publications in Journal of Cell
Biology and Nature Cell Biology.”
If you are writing a letter for someone applying for a position as a physicianscientist, you should comment on his or her bedside manner. For example, if you
are a chief of service, comment on the candidate’s clinical skills and personality
and how he or she interacts with patients.
Talk about personal attributes. Does the candidate work well with others? Has
she or he taught other people in the lab? Has the candidate shown motivation 
and commitment in her or his work? Often these descriptions are what distinguish a good letter of recommendation from a great one.
Make it memorable. Put something in the letter that the reader will remember,
such as an unusual anecdote, or use an unusual term to describe the candidate.
This will help the application stand out from all the others.
Beware of what you leave out. Remember that what is not said in a reference
letter can be just as important as what is said. If you don’t mention a candidate’s
leadership skills or his or her ability to work well with others, for example, the
letter reader will wonder why.
Express Your Willingness to
Help Further
Conclude the letter by offering to be
contacted should the reader need more information or have questions. Make sure to
provide your phone number and perhaps
the best times to reach you.

WRITING A “NOT-SO-ENTHUSIASTIC” LETTER
If you write a letter for someone about whom you have some concerns—for
example, the person lacks strong leadership skills or isn’t highly motivated—you
can still write a generally positive letter, leaving out a mention of these qualities.
This omission will send a signal to readers who will be looking for these details.
A short letter will also signal that you are not overly enthusiastic about the person
for this particular position. If the reviewers are interested in the candidate, they
may call you for more details and you will then have the opportunity to explain
your reservations.
You can also mention negative things by putting a positive spin on them. For
example, if someone has not published much you can say “candidate x has taken
a long time to get experiments going but
now has several papers in press and I think
they will make an important contribution
to the field.”
Yet another way to make a criticism sound
less damaging is to say something like
“when candidate x came to the lab his
writing skills were poorly developed, but
he has worked hard to improve them and
has made great strides in that direction.” 
Terms like “room for improvement,” “has worked hard to,” and “made great
progress in” are useful and help turn a negative into a positive.

WHAT THE LETTER SHOULD NOT SAY
Avoid Irrelevant Information
Letters should not mention anything that is irrelevant to doing the job, such
as ethnicity, age, hobbies, marital status, and so on. A writer might want to say
things like “candidate x understands how important it is to have a lab team that
functions well and has organized several social events for the lab that have helped
make it both productive and happy” to show that the person is social and easy to
get along with. That is something that might be important to the job. In some
cases, personal information may illustrate the ability to persevere and overcome
adversity, qualities that are helpful in research.
But statements like “candidate x is very religious and has demonstrated religious
fervor uncommon for someone his age” has no bearing on whether someone will
do well in graduate school or in a job.
Personal information may be revealed if it helps explain a weakness in someone’s
application. For example, sometimes there are acceptable circumstances for a gap
in someone’s publication record—perhaps a medical condition or a family situation kept that person out of the lab for a period of time. It is okay to explain that
in the letter of recommendation but only after discussing it with the candidate.
Another example of a personal situation that might warrant discussion would
be a case in which a postdoc is not able to ask his or her advisor for a letter of
recommendation because of a bad relationship. If you, as the letter writer, know
about this situation, you might want to mention in the letter that “there was a
personality conflict but it does not reflect on the ability of the candidate to do
the job.”

Don’t Say Anything That Is Not True
Obviously, all information in a letter of recommendation should be, to the best
of your knowledge, accurate. But sometimes letter writers stretch the truth to
make a candidate sound better than he or she really is, thinking it is helpful.
This strategy can backfire. According to a member of a recent search committee,
the head of one lab wrote letters for three applicants from his lab, and in each
letter he stated that the applicant was “the best postdoc ever in my lab.” Most
researchers say that the most effective letters they receive include some weakness
to balance the strengths. 

BE AWARE OF GENDER BIAS
Choose Your Words Wisely
Two studies have shown that there may be some differences in the choice of
words used in letters for male and female scientists. Both Trix and Psenka (2003)
and Schmader, Whitehead, and Wysocki (2007) found that letters for women
did not contain as many “standout” adjectives—words like “superb,” “outstanding,” and “excellent”—as did letters for men. In addition, Trix and Psenka found
that letters for women had more doubt-raising statements, including negative or
unexplained comments. 

If you say that Chris works well in a team—that might be
interpreted differently depending on whether Chris is male
or female. Exactly the same language can convey different
messages because of people’s antecedent beliefs about gender
differences. The reader might infer that Chris the man is
a good team leader or someone who can work well with
a team even when he isn’t a leader of it. Chris the woman,
in contrast, may look as if she can’t or doesn’t lead. For
both men and women, then, it is good to be explicit that
the person is both a good team leader and can work
collaboratively.”
—Virginia Valian, Hunter Colleg


Test for Possible Bias
Although it is not clear what the effect of the choice of words is, it seems plausible that the words you use will affect the reader’s perception of the candidate—
the stronger the words, the stronger the candidate. In an exercise conducted at 
the 2005 BWF-HHMI Course in Laboratory Management, course participants
were asked to read two letters written by the same professor for two postdocs
in his lab, one male and one female (see
appendix), with similar qualifications and
achievements. The professor used more
specific and descriptive language, as well
as more standout adjectives, for the male
candidate than for the female candidate
(see summary document, appendix). As a
result, course participants overwhelmingly
gave the male postdoc a higher ranking
than the female postdoc.










Some years ago I was talking to a visiting scholar who was a faculty member in a foreign country. I asked her why letters from her country seemed to be so uninformative. She pointed out that there, faculty never read letters: they only write them. Even graduate students are admitted purely on the basis of test scores.

The facts were hardly surprising—after all, this is the system I grew up with in India—but after hearing the way she put it, the proverbial bulb lit up. If you never evaluate letters yourself, how would you know what letters should and shouldn't contain? The feedback—admission decisions—is seemingly random, and therefore of little use. Hence this article.

Disclaimer: This is an extremely personal opinion. It doesn't represent the views of my department or my university. More importantly, many faculty may disagree with the opinions here, so use them with caution! Feedback welcome.

What this document is about: Writing effective recommendation letters for PhD students applying to computer science PhD programs in the US.

Whom this is for: Letter-writers who are unsure of what makes for a good letter. This may also help students prepare better dossiers to give their letter-writers. (A brave student might even point her letter-writer to this article.)

Why Letters Matter
Does anyone read the letters at all? We do, rigorously, sometimes as carefully as we read a research paper: pen in hand, circling comments, annotating margins, noting what the letter did and didn't say.

In fact, letters are so important, even a bad transcript can be offset by them. I know a student who got into a fine graduate program with just a 2.67 GPA. This is because his 2.67 was special: he aced hard classes and got bored in easy ones. His letters presumably said so, and illustrated this with several anecdotes. So, not every 2.67 is equal, and your student's may be of just the right kind; but we won't know that without your letter.

My Constraints (or, The One-Minute Rule)
When I'm on the committee, I try to read every application; when I chair it, I make sure I do, some multiple times. That's many hundreds of applications in under a month. Factor in lots and lots of late letters, classes, etc., and it's clear I have to work pretty fast.

For the first pass—deciding whether the application deserves more time or not—I can afford to spend no more than about 6-7 minutes per application. (Keep in mind I've read maybe a few thousand applications, so I've had practice.) If I decide the application is promising, I may spend over half an hour (in some cases, days!) on it. But in those first 6-7 minutes, I have to:

eyeball the student's research record
form a summary of the transcript
glance at the standardized test scores
determine whether the statement is promising
get the gist of 2-3 letters of recommendation
In practice, that means I have about one minute to devote to the first reading of your letter. Now think about whether your letter works in this context. (For instance, some letter writers put a big, prominent paragraph of boilerplate legalese at the beginning of their letter, which I have to read before I realize it's irrelevant. Could you have buried that in a postscript? Was that the best use of my minute?)

Call this the One-Minute Rule and write, read, and re-read your letter against this rule before sending it in.

Be Concrete
If you take away just one piece of concrete advice, let it be this.

The single biggest problem with most letters is that they are filled with abstract generalities and infinitives. If we don't know you or your institution, we can't judge what any of these statements mean relative to our standards. Always consider the illustrative anecdote:

 
Due to deadline pressure, I asked him to grow a pumpkin in just one month. As you know it takes over 100 days to grow a pumpkin, but over the weekend he devised a new method to accelerate their growth. On Monday morning I arrived to find not just a pumpkin but a steaming, flavorful pie.
Anecdote about acts of raw coding are only so helpful in understanding research potential, but they're better than nothing (see the section on Corporate Letters, below). An extra book or paper they read, and demonstrated understanding of (again, be concrete about why you believe this), goes a long way.

Triangulation and Credibility
When we read a letter we're supposedly evaluating the student, but we're actually evaluating the letter-writer too. What I care about is not only what you think, but also what I think of what you think. If I don't know you, I need to calibrate you.

Of course, sometimes information can hurt. If you praise research that is no harder than what we assign our first-year undergraduate students, that tells us a lot about your program, but not a lot positive. I saw precisely such a letter back in about 2002; to this day, I can name the college (and the student...). Until that program becomes a whole lot stronger, I wouldn't want to admit anyone from it.

If you've been holding back praise, tell us: If you haven't written a letter this strong since 1998, and you've written two dozen letters in that time, it helps for us to know that. Of course, be honest. If we take you at your word and your student proves to be significantly weaker than your letter, we won't trust your future recommendations.

It also helps to know your track record. Especially if you are a professor at a lesser-known university, tell us where your past graduates have gone. Even better, tell us where they are now (maybe the lack of name-recognition for your school means the students didn't go to well-known places initially, but if they did well and are now placed in good positions, that's good to know). Remember to compare this student to that population.

Finally, tell us a little about your background. A brief para of bio-sketch never hurts. If you publish papers, tell us where. But keep it short: the letter is about the student, not you!

Ultimately, remember two things:

Your most valuable resource is your credibility. If you are a credible letter-writer, we will take you at your word and, if one day you tell us about a stellar student, we will do everything we can to make room for her. But credibility is one-way: hard to acquire, easy to lose.
You can't get a student in, but you can make a student not get in. That is, there is only so much you can say to get a student admitted, but if we come to distrust your letter, your next student is going to have a much harder time getting in. For “you”, substitute your institution also.
Reporting on Research
At a highly-competitive university like Brown, we want to know the student's research potential. The best assessment of this is what they have already done. If you are their research advisor, you have a special obligation to them (and to us) in your letter:

describe their work in your own words
tell us what the student's contribution was
tell us whether it succeeded or failed
if it's ongoing, tell us why you think it will succeed
We rarely expect the ideas to have originated from the student, but we would like to see signs that they took ownership of the project, improved it in some way, refined the idea, and so on. Finally:

put any publications in context
Students don't always know how to do this. If you published a paper on the work, tell us about the quality of the venue. In particular, students are poor at telling different kinds of publications apart (tech report from conference poster from research paper) and may even try to hide the distinction (I've seen this happen). Help us understand what they really accomplished.

If you run a summer research center, you may get bombarded with letter requests from each of your students. I have seen such people write perfunctory one-paragraph letters. These hurt students, and are ultimately unethical. Someone gave you money to run that center; when you asked for it, you took on an obligation. Fulfill it, or else get out of the way. There are plenty of others who will gladly put that money to better use.

Reporting on Courses
Naturally, your most significant contact with the student is likely to be in courses. Yet what could be a rich source of description is often the poorest: Mor Harchol-Balter reports that at CMU, they call a certain class of these “DWIC” letters (“did well in class”), which are effectively useless.

Give us context. What textbook did you use? How much of it did you cover? Did the student take it earlier than usual?

Don't just report the grade; put it in perspective. How many students got that grade or better? If your transcript isn't nuanced (e.g., at Brown we give only letter grades with no +/- decorations), fill it in. Did they do an exceptional job at something? (Tell us what they did!) Were they biased towards some aspect of your class? (For instance, in my programming languages course, some take much better to the theoretical aspects, while others prefer the systems work. The transcript won't reveal this, but it's extremely valuable information for a professor trying to decide whether or not to recruit a student.)

Reporting on Personality
This is tricky, but it can help a potential advisor assess how good a fit the student will be. Some advisors work best with quiet, shy students, others with boisterous ones. Be as honest as necessary. For instance, I've had the pleasure of working with numerous exceptional students, but a few have had more peculiar personalities than the norm. In such cases, I write a “care and feeding” section (this goes back to the bit about credibility). I have never yet known this to be held against the student.

Corporate Letters
An important special case is the corporate letter: when you, the letter-writer, work in industry and have no academic affiliation. Many corporate letters (like many academic letters, but more so) tend to be vapid, clearly written in a different culture and for a different audience. Unless they actually did academic research with you, here are some suggestions for improving them.

A common mistake is to focus on teamwork. This is important even in academia, but often this is the primary focus of the letter, which makes it less valuable. Of course we care about it, but it's secondary to their technical skills.

Tell us if they learned something particularly quickly, mastered a complex technology, or solved a problem others were stuck on. Give us a paragraph of details.
If you have a concrete reason to evaluate research potential, do so concretely. Otherwise, don't bother.
Give us a brief bio-sketch, including educational qualifications.
Put the applicant in context, and tell us the context. It's fine to relate it to your own student days, or to your experience hiring students. E.g.:
 
Compared to the students I studied with at Cucumber and Melon University, and the ones I now recruit from there, I would put him in the top 10%.
Don't Personalize (or, How to Personalize)
Don't waste your time personalizing the letter for each school, unless you really personalize it. I'm not impressed by your mail-merge program. Absolutely nobody cares that you don't list Brown's postal address at the top of the letter. Spend that extra minute or five making the letter better. Besides, invariably, you will mess up: every year we get a handful of letters stuffed in the wrong envelope. It's just not worth the bother.

Of course, you could really personalize a letter by writing a paragraph specific to an institution. But only do this if you really have something to say. For instance, I sometimes write,

 
Hey folks—Eva Echidna is more dedicated than Jonas Jackaroo and every bit as smart as Walter Wallaby, both of whom are past students of mine who appear to be thriving in your program.
You could do this with LaTeX or Word macro trickery. In the days of paper letters it was easy to just do this by hand (everyone knows professors can't afford machines that simulate hand-writing: only alumni offices have that kind of money on campus). It's harder in these all-electronic days.

A simpler, but also important, level of personalization is to take into account the quality of the target institution. Sometimes, students apply to schools well beyond their quality, and you may not be able to talk them out of it (nor, perhaps, should you; they're just exercising their freedom). You may consider having slightly different letters, one for each level of institution. A cheap way to achieve the same effect is to simply mark different boxes in the tables you're asked to fill in (e.g., mark them in a higher percentile for schools where you think they belong, and a lower percentile for places where they will be overmatched).

While we're at it, here's a great instance of customization gone wrong (the ellipses are mine, the rest is literal text):

 
It is my pleasure to recommend ... be admitted to the PhD in Computer Science program at Brown University. I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science, the University of ..., where I have taught for [THIS MANY] years.
Didn't even proof-read it, eh?

Ask Your Student for Help
Ah yes! Here's where I tell you to ask the student to write a draft of their own letter. Not.

Asking students to write even a draft of their own letter is one of the shabbiest practices I can imagine. Yes, I know, many otherwise respectable people do it (I've even had more than one letter-writer of mine—people I respect profoundly—ask me to). I've heard arguments about how it helps a student demonstrate professionalism, maturity, and so on. This isn't the place to explain why I'm completely unswayed.

So what do I mean?

I tell my students to give me a list of everything about them that they think is relevant. I explicitly tell them to brag (some students are shy and may not give themselves enough credit otherwise): filtering their input is my job, not theirs, and I say so. Sometimes I do get items that are over-the-top, but no harm done. Much more often a student will remind me of something they did that I had forgotten, but was well worth remembering.

In particular, for my top research students who are currently working with me, I have no shortage of information. But for the others, or ones I haven't worked with in a while, this helps immensely. Some item suddenly brings them alive after several years, helping me reconstruct forgotten details and provide an illustration or two.

Tell Us About Relevant Things That Didn't Happen
Sometimes the negative spaces also matter: a statement like

 
Despite my best efforts to persuade her to work with me, Eva decided to spend her second summer working for the Rocky Raccoon Corporation, a local maker of surveillance equipment. Because of this I cannot say much about her research skills, but I'm told she did good work there. Moreover, her experience in industry convinced her she would rather be in graduate school.
can, in some contexts, tell the reader a lot.

Help Your Students Form a Strategy
It's very frustrating to get three essentially identical letters. If you are the advisor (or even simply someone who thinks the student deserves to do well), take a little time to help students plan out their application strategy. Ask them who their other writers are, help them find writers who can highlight all their strengths, and identify pointless overlap. Summarize anything you think we should know about: e.g.,

 
I know that Eva did a superb project with Prof Dolfenfuss—I was blown away by the creativity of their work on intrusion detection for raccoons that raid pumpkin patches. She's told me she has asked Dr. D. for a letter, so I trust he will elaborate.
Just Say No
Don't write a letter because you're feeling bad for a student. We can tell from your letter, and it won't help the student one bit. Just say no. If you really care for the student, spend that time instead helping him find letter-writers who can better get across his talents. Heck, maybe he shouldn't be applying to graduate school at all, at least not right now. A few minutes of your time may save him years of his.

Practice the Fundamentals
Mail the darned thing in on time! We don't begin to read applications until they are “sufficiently complete” to be worth the time. While you're crafting your prose for the Paris Review (and fidgeting with the details of your mail merge program), your student's folder is becoming close friends with the historic, 200+-year-old, pre-Revolutionary War dust in the corner of some office building at Brown.

== Generating Detail for Your Letter

One of the greatest challenges for many faculty writing letters of reference is how to generate effective detail. The answer to this challenge usually involves getting to know the student better, matching persuasive examples and evidence to the appropriate criteria, and understanding the common expectations readers have about detail.

Partnering with the Student on the Process
Some faculty require no help from the student in preparing a letter and don’t feel they should involve the student directly, but most ask for the student’s input, using it as a way to generate detail. Some faculty even advocate that the student begin the process by drafting a letter for them to work from. Even if that particular approach doesn't suit you, some form of partnership with the student in the process can be mutually beneficial.

Common ways that faculty partner with students to generate letter detail include: 

asking students for copies of relevant application materials, looking for clues about the audience needs.
reviewing a copy of the student’s resume, a writing sample, a written proposal, a graded paper, or a list of achievements.
asking for a copy of the student’s transcript, so that you can put his or her academic performance into perspective.
interviewing students, in person or by-email, asking questions such as why they want a particular job or entrance into a program, what their long-term goals are, where their strengths and weaknesses lie, how they view their chosen profession, and what circumstances brought them to their current career path—then including this detail in the letter.
At a minimum, most faculty at least review a student’s resume to help generate detail for their letter, which also helps students to view themselves as professionals.

One example from a faculty member at North Seattle College represents the above approach perfectly. In her Process for Getting a Recommendation Letter(link is external) page, this faculty member spells out her protocol to her students, attending to everything from practical materials that she needs to write the letter to reminding the student to follow up with her. Such an approach helps students to understand the process and uplifts it to something closer to an appropriately professional partnership between mentor and mentee.

Giving Context to Your Relationship with the Student
Employers and committees are always interested in how you came to know and how long you have known a student, and many writers open their letters by directly stating this. Especially if you teach an upper-level course or run a lab or program, it can be effective to describe succinctly the curriculum or the exact nature of the class or work, including the types of students involved, texts studied, or goals and initiatives. Curriculum detail or a description of a student’s work community can also provide a handy segue for you to compare the student to others.

Despite the need to establish your relationship with the student, you must leave the reader with a strong impression that your ultimate connection to the student is a professional one. Beware of overstating your relationship, presenting it as too emotional or overly personal, or worse, puzzling through it right on the page.

Enhancing Your Own Credibility
This can be a tricky matter and it is sometimes best left alone, but subtly or directly enhancing your credibility can greatly aid a student if the circumstances warrant. For instance, if you are a professional engineer and the student also aims to be one eventually, citing your background briefly in connection with the student’s potential will certainly uplift the student. Likewise, if you’ve been teaching for thirty years and this student is among the top ten you have had in your classes, when you mention both of these facts you catapult the student in the audience’s estimation. Clearly, you do not wish to risk discussing your credentials in too much detail or for no apparent reason. Be selective and restrained, focusing principally on the student’s background and connection to yours.

Using Language That Reflects the Appropriate Criteria
When matching a student’s abilities to specific criteria, there is, of course, the danger of just lifting the criteria from a form and plugging in the student’s name alongside them: “I feel that [insert student name here] has strong analytical skills, emotional stability, maturity, and motivation.” Instead, use the language of the criteria, perhaps even by grounding your topic sentences in the diction, and apply the criteria directly to your experiences with the student. Thus: “John’s analytical skills have surfaced clearly in both his writing and his senior project.”

Providing Examples and Evidence
A letter of recommendation lives or dies on its examples and evidence. Not surprisingly, research shows that the specificity of the examples used in a letter enhances the perceived credibility of the writer, in some cases even more so than numerical data (1). Among the best ways to present concrete examples about student’s accomplishments are:

compare the student to others, especially peers, graduate students, or professionals;
comment on the student’s role in your classroom dynamic;
quote from a paper the student wrote or otherwise interpret the student’s qualitative work;
detail what your colleagues think of the student;
discuss the student’s contribution to a team or in a lab setting, including a brief discussion of the team goals or research hypotheses;
describe the student’s self-assessment of accomplishments, if known, and compare it to your own assessment of the student’s abilities;
discuss your student’s favorable contribution to the recommendation letter or application process itself, highlighting evidence of professionalism;
offer the student’s grade, academic record, or other types of quantitative measures used for evaluation (note the “Recommendation Letters and the Law” section in Chapter 1).
Be especially careful when using data in relation to student evaluation. Letter writers sometimes make claims such as “This student is in the top 5% of the nation’s graduates” without evidence to back it up, and thus the claim loses credibility. Also, beware of providing too much quantitative data about a student or appearing to have simply retreated to your grade book or attendance records to define a student’s academic character. Grades are good evidence, but only briefly—especially when letter readers possess the student’s transcript anyway. Emphasize virtues not apparent from a transcript.

Finally, amidst your specific examples, keep in mind that letter writers should also give attention to, as one educator puts it, “some general qualities employers would like to see in a candidate” (2). Tie your examples directly to traits and qualities that employers and grad schools seek, such as initiative, aptitude, trainability, willingness to learn, enthusiasm, leadership, self-motivation, intelligence, adaptability, imagination, and communication skills.

An effective reference letter could mean the difference between a candidate's acceptance or rejection. You may be a person requesting a reference letter, or you may be a person writing a reference letter. In either case, the information in this article can make both requesting and writing the letter easier. A reference letter is essentially the same as a recommendation letter but the reference letter is sent to an unknown employer, whereas a recommendation letter is sent to a known employer. Primarily, a reference letter is used to introduce a person and vouch for his integrity, character, and abilities.

This article discusses:

Reference letter tips
Requesting a Reference Letter/Letter of Reference
Before you request a reference letter, here are a few things to keep in mind:
Ask for a reference letter from people who know you and your capabilities, such as former employers, teachers, coaches, community or corporate leaders, influential friends who have known you a long time, etc. Relatives are not a good choice. Three letters are usually enough.
Be sure to give the people you ask enough time to write the reference letter—a week to 10 days should be sufficient.
Tell the people who agree to write letters for you about your goals and what they could write that would help you to achieve those goals. Don't be shy. A reference letter is a sales letter that is intended to sell you. Now is the time to point out your accomplishments!
Follow up your request with a review of your conversation in writing. In your letter it may be helpful to suggest specific phrases or sentences that the writer could put in your letter. When you send your follow-up letter, be sure to also include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. If you don't receive your reference letters within 10 days of your conversations with the prospective writers, you may need to contact them to confirm that each is aware of your deadlines.
Once you receive your reference letters, send the writers thank-you notes. You should also let each writer know about your subsequent success and how much their letters helped you to attain your goal.

Agreeing to Write a Reference Letter/Letter of Reference
Are you the right person to write a reference letter? If you are asked to write a letter of reference, you may need to discuss this subject with the requester. Can you honestly write positive things about the person who has requested the letter? If not, you should bow out gracefully at the beginning. On the other hand, if you feel you qualify, brainstorm with the requester so you can write what he or she wishes to be said, and be sensitive to his/her deadlines.

Have the person give you a list of accomplishments, organizations that he/she belongs to, or any other relevant information. It might surprise you to see how much that person has done outside of your personal contact with them. This can also help you get a more accurate picture of the individual. Having the person give you a copy of his/her resume is an easy way to have this information at hand. Keep in mind, however, that you can only vouch for what you know from your own personal experience with the individual.


How to Write a Reference Letter
Here are some easy guidelines (in no specific order):

Explain how you know the applicant and how long you have known him/her.
In what respect is this person exceptional to others you have known with a similar background? List the applicant's exceptional qualities and skills, especially those that are related to the applicant's field of interest or job search. Give specific examples to back up what you have written.
Refer to the requester's competency in a specific field and/or prior experience, organizational and communication skills, academic or other achievements, interaction with others, sound judgment, reliability, analytical ability, etc.
Omit weaknesses. If you can't write a positive letter of reference, you should diplomatically decline when you are first approached.
State your own qualifications. Why should the reader be impressed with your reference letter?
Emphasize key points that you want the reader to take note of on the resume or application. Be sure to elaborate meaningfully; don't simply restate what he/she has already written.
Unless it is absolutely relevant, do not refer (either in a direct or implied reference) to the applicant's race, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender, or marital status.
Don't be too brief, but be succinct and make every word count. Generally speaking, a letter of reference for employment should be one page; a letter of reference for school admission should be one to two pages.
List your own contact information if you are willing to receive follow-up correspondence or answer questions.
Make the ending strong without overdoing it. Undue praise can be viewed as biased or insincere.
Proofread! The letter of reference represents both you and the applicant.

Reference Letter Tips
Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

Appearance. Type your reference letter. Your reference letter casts a reflection on both you and the candidate. Appearance may even determine if it will be read or not. Print the letter on good quality ink-jet paper.

Specifics. Concentrate on several different aspects of the person. Be specific when you refer to his/her skills, attitude, personal attributes, contributions, performance, growth, etc. during the time period you have known the candidate.

Word usage.

Be careful with "power words"! Some words that seem harmless in every day conversation can carry both positive and negative connotations when written and presented to a prospective employer. Here are a few positive adjectives: honest, articulate, effective, sophisticated, intelligent, observant, significant, expressive, creative, efficient, cooperative, imaginative, dependable, reliable, mature, and innovative.
Avoid adjectives and adverbs that carry a mediocre connotation such as: nice, good, fair, fairly, adequate, reasonable, decent, and satisfactory.
Attributes. The National Association of Colleges and Employers compiled the following list of attributes. They can be exceptional topics to address as you describe the candidate:

ability to communicate
intelligence
self-confidence
willingness to accept responsibility
initiative
leadership
energy level
imagination
flexibility
interpersonal skills
self-knowledge
ability to handle conflict
goal achievement
competitiveness
appropriate vocational skills
direction
Intangible qualities. The ASCUS Annual listed the following intangible qualities as important when evaluating teaching candidates—a good list to consider for other vocations as well:

empathy
native intelligence
a divergent, abstract thinking style
a high level of commitment
the ability to be a "self-starter"
a high energy level
the recognition that excellence is a journey, not a destination
the potential ability to lead



At some point in life, you’re almost certainly going to have to write a reference letter for someone. It might be a former employee or student, or even a family friend. Here’s what you need to know about the purpose of reference letters and how to write the most effective letter possible.

Note: I will be using “candidate” to refer to the person who the reference letter is about, “you” to refer to the person writing the reference letter, and “recipient” to refer to the person receiving the letter. I’ll emphasise here, though, that reference letters are not only for job or academic “candidates”, it’s just a handy term to use to keep this article straightforward!

What is a reference letter and when are they used?
A reference letter is usually written to testify to a person or (occasionally) a company’s skills, character and/or achievements. Sometimes a reference letter is known as a “recommendation letter”. It is a formal document, and should be typed and written in a serious and business-like style.

Reference letters are used in a wide variety of situations; there is no definitive list that covers all possible scenarios. The most common examples are:

When a candidate applies for a job, they may need a reference to support their application.
If an interviewee is given a job offer, they may need to supply a reference letter before the contract can be signed.
A student applying for an academic course often requires a reference letter to support their application.
A student applying for funding will often need to supply reference letters.
Companies may use reference letters as testimonies to their trustworthiness and ability to carry out a job well.
Prospective tenants may need to provide their landlord with a reference letter, testifying to their good financial status. (This could be from a prior landlord or from a current employer.)
Who should write a reference letter?
If you are approached and asked to write a reference letter for a job candidate, a student or a company, consider whether you can legitimately do so. A reference letter is a formal document, and it is crucial that you do not lie or fudge the truth in it, or there could be legal repercussions. If someone wants a reference letter from you:

The candidate should be someone you know reasonably well. For example, you cannot provide any authoritative comment on the academic ability of a student who’s only been attending your lectures for a week.
You should know the candidate in a capacity which gives you the ability to write a meaningful reference. For example, if you have worked with the person, it would be appropriate for you to write a reference letter to a prospective employer for them.
You should be able to provide an honest and positive reference. If you truly feel that the candidate has no good qualities for you to emphasis, or if you have had a personality clash with them in the past, you should tell them to seek a reference letter from someone else.
What goes into a reference letter?
The exact structure of a reference letter will differ slightly depending on the type of reference it is, but this is a good basic outline:

Start using the business letter format: put the recipient’s name and address, if known, and address them as “Dear [name]”. If the recipient is currently unknown (this would be likely on an academic application, for instance), then use “Dear Sir/Madam” or “To whom it may concern”.
It is often helpful to introduce yourself in the first couple of lines of your letter. The recipient will not need your life history: just give a brief sentence or two explaining your position and your relationship to the candidate.
Your next paragraph should confirm any facts which you know the candidate will be supplying along with your letter. For example, if you are writing a reference for a job applicant, some or all of these details may be appropriate:
The person’s job title, and role within the company.
The person’s leaving salary when they were last employed by you (or your organisation).
The dates which the person was employed from and until.
If you are writing a reference letter for an academic course, you will need to confirm the person’s academic grades.

In your third paragraph, you should provide your judgement upon the candidate’s skills and qualities. It is often appropriate to state that you would gladly re-employ them, or that their contributions to your college class were highly valued. Single out any exceptional qualities that the candidate has – perhaps their drive and enthusiasm, their attention to detail, or their ability to lead.
Where possible, use your fourth paragraph to give a couple of concrete examples of times when the candidate excelled. (You may want to ask the candidate to tell you about any extra-curricular projects they’ve been involved in, or invite them to highlight anything they’d particularly like you to include in the reference letter.)
Close your letter on a positive note, and if you are willing to receive further correspondence about the candidate’s application, make this clear. Include your contact details too.
As with any business letter, you should end appropriately; “Yours sincerely” when you are writing to a named recipient, and “Yours faithfully” when you do not know who will be receiving the letter.
Things to avoid

Make sure that you avoid:

Mentioning any weaknesses the candidate has.
Saying anything that could be construed as libel.
Writing in an informal manner: keep the letter business-like. Jokes, slang and casual language are not appropriate and may harm the candidate’s chances.
Including personal information not relevant to the application. Mentioning the candidate’s race, political stance, religion, nationality, marital status, age or health is usually inappropriate.
Spelling mistakes, sloppy writing or typos: this letter is hugely important to the candidate, and you should take care to make it look professional.
Reference Letter Examples
There are a number of good templates for reference letters available on Business Balls. I’ve included one below, which would be appropriate for a general-purpose reference – if you were writing a reference in your capacity as the candidate’s former employer, you would need to include more specific details:

Date

To whom it may concern

I confirm that I have known (name) for (number) years.

(State relationship – social, business, working together in some other capacity, club, activity, project, etc.)

At all times I have found (name/him/her) to be (state characteristics – eg, dependable, reliable, hard-working, conscientious, honest, peace-loving, courteous, etc – to be as helpful as possible think about what the reader will most prefer to see, in terms of satisfying concerns, or seeing evidence of relevant required skills or characteristics).

I’m happy to provide further information if required. (optional)

Yours faithfully, etc.

You can find examples of full reference letters on About.com’s “job searching” section. They list letters appropriate for a variety of different situations: here’s one from a previous employer in support of a job candidate:

To Whom it May Concern:

I highly recommend Jane Doe as a candidate for employment. Jane was employed by Company Name as an Administrative Assistant from 2002 – 2005. Jane was responsible for office support including word processing, scheduling appointments and creating brochures, newsletters, and other office literature.

Jane has excellent communication skills. In addition, she is extremely organized, reliable and computer literate. Jane can work independently and is able to follow through to ensure that the job gets done. She is flexible and willing to work on any project that is assigned to her. Jane was quick to volunteer to assist in other areas of company operations, as well.

Jane would be a tremendous asset for your company and has my highest recommendation. If you have any further questions with regard to her background or qualifications, please do not hesitate to call me.

Sincerely,

John Smith
Title
Company
Address
Phone
Email

If you are still unsure what best to include in the reference letter, imagine yourself in the position of the candidate’s prospective employer, or of the panel reading his/her academic application. What information would they need to know? What qualities would they like their candidates to have? Obviously, you should never lie or mislead in a reference letter, but you should try to focus on areas which will give the recipient the most useful information possible about the candidate.

Video Recap


How to Ask for a Reference Letter
If you’re in the position of requiring a reference from a past employer or from someone who taught you at school or university, then you need to approach them in an appropriate way.

“Appropriate” might be quite formal or quite informal, depending on your relationship with them. For instance, if you’re approaching a lecturer who taught you along with dozens of other students and who does not know you well, it’s appropriate to be quite formal; if you’re approaching your former line manager, who you shared nights out and weekends away with for years, then being formal would seem strangely standoffish.

In a fairly formal context, you might write something like this:

Dear (name)

I hope all is going well (at their company / in their department).

I’m applying for (give brief details of the role or position you’re applying for). Would you be able to provide a reference letter for me? I’d be very grateful. You can send it to  (add the name and contact details here)

With thanks in advance,

(Your name)

If you’re approaching someone who you’re on very friendly terms with, it’s really up to you to decide what to say.

Whatever the situation, it often makes sense to mention particular points that it would be helpful for the reference to cover (e.g. “The company is especially keen to know about my experience with summarising complex information quickly, as that will be a major part of the role.”)

It can also be helpful to include details that the person writing the letter may not be aware of. For instance, if you took part in significant extra-curricular activities at university alongside your studies, you may want to mention this.

Writing a Reference Letter: Quick Summary
When you’re writing a reference letter, you should:

Ascertain why the referee needs the letter. A reference letter for an academic position will read very different from a reference letter for a prospective landlord.
Consider whether you can reasonably provide the type of reference required. If you do not know the candidate well, or if you are unable to give them a positive reference, you should encourage them to seek someone else.
Format your letter as a standard business letter, and briefly introduce yourself at the start.
Confirm key facts about the applicant (e.g. how long they worked for you, and in what role).
Provide your judgement upon the candidate’s skills and qualities. Be honest, but do focus on the things that you feel will reflect the candidate in a positive light.
If you’re asking someone to provide a reference letter, you should approach them in an appropriate way, and give them the information they need in order to write you a good reference.

== Providing Content Based on Field of Study

Besides being specific to the student being recommended in a letter, one of the most persuasive tactics you can use is to provide detail tailored to the student’s field of study. Assuming an audience that shares specialized knowledge, you can better inform the audience about a candidate by selectively showcasing anything from a poem written by the student to a technique that the student mastered in your lab. Also, an awareness and articulation of the attributes most valued in a particular field of study will help improve a candidate’s chances.

What follows are some ideas for providing content specific to a field of study. Although it certainly can be argued that it’s impossible to limit these list members to one particular field, I’ve populated this list based on some commonly accepted skills and experiences expected within these fields.

Letter Formatting
Before writing any letter of recommendation, each student or alumnus should provide you with a signed waiver statement that specifies whether they are requesting the content of the letter to be confidential or non-confidential. This waiver statement must be submitted with the actual letter. The Letter Service will not allow the individual access to a confidential letter but will allow the individual access to non-confidential letters. The individual should verify that his or her choice is acceptable to you before you write the letter.
Beginning August 1, 2001 due to a change in California law, letters received by the Career Center Letter Service will be identified as non-confidential or confidential for the receiving educational institutions.

Letter of Recommendation Forms
Letters may be submitted on your professional letterhead. If you prefer to use the Career Center Letter Forms, you may download PDF forms here. Letters should not be printed on plain paper or duplex (on both sides of paper). Please do not submit a letter on more than one form unless they are different letters. For example do not write a letter on the Letter Form and another identical letter on the Ranking Grid Form. The version of the pdf Letter Forms below have fillable form fields, which will allow you to type or paste text directly into them before printing and signing. If you are looking for the waiver statement, only the client can access it from the Main Menu of their online file. The client must login to their online file and print the waiver statement and give it to you so that it can accompany the letter.
 Letter Form (PDF)
 Letter Form with Ranking Grid (PDF)
If you choose to use these letter forms with fillable form fields, it is recommended that the text be created in a word processing application (e.g. Word) with 1" left and right margins and a 1.75" top margin. Set the bottom margin to 2" for the Letter Form or 3.25" for the Letter Form with Ranking Grid. The text can then be copied and pasted into the form. Text can only be saved in the word processing application. The online form is simply a formatting tool that allows a hard copy to be printed. The form will not allow text to be saved. Please note that the form will only accommodate a certain number of lines: approx. 36 lines on the ranking grid form and approx. 44 lines on the basic form. Letters may be continued on additional sheets if necessary. These forms still need to have an original signature and be submitted by mail or in person.

In accordance with federal laws and university policy, authors of letters of recommendation are asked to refrain from comments regarding candidate's race, color, gender, religion, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, medical condition, or political affiliations, beliefs or activities.
Letters should be typewritten or word-processed and signed in dark ink. Handwritten letters do not scan clearly.
Letters should not reference a particular institution or program, e.g., "I highly recommend Student X for admission to UC Berkeley College of Law."
Letters should conclude with legible identifying personal information: full name, title, institution, mailing address, telephone number and email address. You will receive an email confirmation informing you that we have received your letter. If UCLink is experiencing problems, you may not receive this email.
Forwarding Your Letter to the Letter Service
We strongly suggest that you retain a copy of your letter for your records.
Letters and waivers may be sent by campus mail, by regular or express mail, by courier, or may be hand-delivered. Please seal the letter in an envelope and sign across the seal so that we will know that it has not been opened en route. If you hand-deliver an unsealed letter to the Letter Service, staff may ask to see identification to verify that you are the author of the letter.

Guidelines for Writing Recommendations for:

Academic Graduate School
Indicate how long you have known the applicant and in what capacity. Graduate schools are primarily interested in recommendations that come from professors who know the applicant and his/her academic work as well as from employers. They are primarily interested in faculty members' summary estimates of the candidate's general promise as a graduate student. The more the recommendation reflects real knowledge of the applicant and his/her performance, the more useful the letter is to the graduate school admissions committees and thus to the applicant. The letter should address the following questions:

Intellectual characteristics: How do you rate the applicant in overall intelligence? How well does the applicant learn and retain information? What is your assessment of the applicant's skill in analysis and logic? What is the applicant's ability to deal with complex or abstract matters? Does the applicant show evidence of creativity? Has the applicant's academic record been affected by special circumstances such as work, social or academic background?
Knowledge of field of study: What is the applicant's depth and breadth of knowledge in the field? Does he/she know how to use the methods in the field of study or have the experience in research? Where applicable, does the applicant have the requisite laboratory techniques?
Ability to communicate: Is the applicant an effective writer? Does the written work submitted demonstrate a mastery of the convention of English? Is the written material clear, well-organized and forceful? Is the applicant articulate in oral expression?
Industry and self-discipline: To what extent is the applicant persistent, efficient and motivated? Is the applicant able to work independently? Is there any reason to doubt the applicant's commitment to graduate study or diligence as a student?
Personal effectiveness: Does the applicant possess the qualities of maturity and personal adjustment requisite for graduate study? Would you choose the applicant for graduate study under your tutelage? Does the applicant enjoy the trust and respect of fellow students and peers?
Potential for graduate study: What is your prediction of the applicant's probable performance in graduate school? Does he/she have any specialized skill or studies in the field? Does the applicant have an aptitude for the chosen field? How does this applicant rate with other candidates who have been evaluated?

Business School
Business schools are primarily interested in recommendations from professors who know the applicant and his/her academic work, as well as from employers. Note: Schools which usually only accept applicants with several years or more of full-time experience often place greater importance on letters from employers. They are interested in summary estimates of the applicant's general promise as a student of business. The more the evaluation reflects real knowledge of the applicant and his/her performance, the more useful the letter is to the business school admissions committees and thus to the applicant. The letter should address the following:

Interpersonal skills and leadership ability: How effective is the candidate in establishing and maintaining relationships? How well does he or she work with and/or through supervisors, peers and subordinates? How do you assess the applicant's ability to lead, ability to delegate responsibility, sensitivity to those less competent and potential for future success as an administrator? Has the applicant demonstrated willingness to work in a team environment?
Personal achievements: Has the applicant sought or created opportunities to make use of his or her native ability and how effectively has he/she exploited it? How do the applicant's achievements compare to those of his/her peers?
Candidate's insight into his or her own assets and liabilities: Will the applicant accept constructive criticism? Will he/she accept a challenge with self-confidence, admit mistakes and ask for help when needed?
Intellectual qualifications: What is your assessment of the applicant's analytical skills and ability to grasp new ideas? Has the applicant's academic record been affected by any special circumstances such as work or academic background? Does the applicant have the ability to apply his/her knowledge creatively?
Ability to communicate: Is the applicant an effective writer? Does the written work submitted demonstrate a mastery of the conventions of English? Is the written material clear, well-organized and forceful? Is the applicant articulate in oral expression?
Industry and self-discipline: To what extent does the applicant possess the traits of persistence, efficiency and motivation? Is there any reason to doubt the applicant's diligence as a student?
Potential for the study of business: What is your prediction of the applicant's probable performance in the study of business? How well do you think the applicant has thought out plans for graduate study? Among others recommended for business school, how does this candidate rate?
Is there any other information about the applicant which you would like to share with admissions committees?

Law School
Law schools are primarily interested in recommendations that come from professors who know the student and his/her academic work, as well as from employers who can write about the factors noted below. They are interested in summary estimates of the candidate's general promise as a student of law. The more the evaluation reflects real knowledge of the student and his/her performance, the more useful the letter is to the law school's admissions committee and thus to the student. Indicate how long you have known the applicant and in what capacity. It should address the following questions:

Personal effectiveness: Is the applicant the kind of person you would choose to consult as a lawyer? Does the applicant enjoy the trust and respect of professors and fellow students?
Intellectual qualifications: What is your assessment of the applicant's analytical skills and ability to grasp new ideas? Has the applicant's academic record been affected by any special circumstances such as work, social or academic background? What is the applicant's ability to deal with complex or abstract matters?
Ability to communicate: Is the applicant an effective writer? Does the written work submitted demonstrate a mastery of the conventions of English? Is the written expression clear, well-organized and forceful? Is the applicant articulate in oral expression?
Industry and self-discipline: To what extent does the applicant possess the traits of persistence, efficiency and motivation? Is there any reason to doubt the applicant's commitment to law study or the applicant's diligence as a student?
Potential for the study of law: What is your prediction of the applicant's probable performance in the study of law? Would the applicant stand in the top quarter, near mid-class or simply make the grade in a rigorous program? Do you have any special familiarity with the process of legal education?
Is there any other information about the applicant which you would like to share with admissions committees?

Health Professions Schools
Health professions schools are interested in recommendations which come from professors, research supervisors, etc., who know the student and his/her academic work well. The more the evaluation reflects real knowledge of the student and his/her performance, the more useful the letter is to both the school and the student. Letters which say little more than what the student received for a grade are of very limited value. Comments which help to put the student's performance in perspective and make clear the letter writer's opportunity to evaluate the student are very helpful. For example, comments concerning the grading scale or the level at which the class is taught may make your evaluation more meaningful. Health professions schools desire your opinion on the following:

Academic ability: Characteristics to be rated might include intelligence, how well a student learns and retains information, skill in expressing ideas in oral and written form, ability to deal with complex or abstract matters, evidence of creativity, interest in the subject matter of the course, ability to work independently, laboratory skills and techniques if appropriate.
Personality traits: Please comment on the applicant's dependability, sincerity, integrity, relations with others, personal adjustment, maturity, initiative, and motivation for a health profession. The applicant's weaknesses as well as strengths should also be pointed out.
Knowledge and suitability for intended profession (if known): Schools often place great importance on the applicant having a clear understanding of the intended field from direct experience. When possible, comment on the applicant's exposure to the realities of the career field and the applicant's suitability for the profession.
Overall potential: Summary judgments which rank the applicant with past and present candidates are desired.

Medical School
Your letter makes a difference. Many of the medical schools that receive large number of Cal student applications must choose from among more than 5,000 applicants to matriculate 120 medical students. The insight that you provide in your letter of evaluation is essential to the admissions committee making decisions in this difficult selection process.

Your letter is part of a packet of letters. Cal medical school applicants should have three substantial letters, two from science instructors and one from a humanities instructor. Some schools will accept additional letters. The cover sheet for letters sent to medical schools from the Letter Service indicates that Cal does not have a pre-professional committee or ranking system and that students individually solicit letters from faculty.

Medical schools are looking for insight you, the letter writer, can give about this particular person, and especially seek your opinion in the following areas:

Intellectual readiness: Include comments about general intelligence, the student's oral and written communication skills, ability to deal with complex and abstract ideas, evidence of being a lifelong independent learner. A letter that merely states the grade earned by an applicant in your class has very limited value. Can this person handle the load of medical school?
Motivation for medicine: If you have some knowledge of the student's experiences learning about medicine or experiences with volunteer work in a health care setting, comment on the applicant's exposure to the realities of medicine.
Maturity: Your impressions of this person as someone who has the integrity and emotional maturity to take on responsibility. Do you think this student could discuss intimate or sensitive topics with a variety of people? Is this someone you would trust to care for you or a loved one?
Difficulty of course work or major: It is helpful to explain how this student measures up with past and present candidates and to provide a context for their performance. If you have the impression that the bioengineering major is especially demanding for particular reasons, explain this as you make your remarks about a bioengineering major. If you have never seen a sociology major perform so well in your upper division biochemistry course, write this observation.
Special attributes and assets: Have you noticed the student often helps others in the hallway while waiting for class to start? Express your opinions and share any observations that illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the student.
It is the student's right to decide if the letter is confidential or non-confidential. Some may discuss this with you. Many medical school admissions officers have stated that they find a confidential letter a display of confidence on the part of the applicant. Because the law has changed, the Letter Service is now required to indicate on the letter if it is confidential or non-confidential.

It is a good idea to use the pronoun "we" in a co-signed letter. If a GSI will write the letter, and a professor will "co-sign", it is best if the letter is written using the term "we", as in "we saw that Mr. Thorpe became more engaged as the class time included poetry readings".

== Writing for Special Circumstances


As writers, we don’t always have ready words for every circumstance. When writing letters, special circumstances frequently arise and we may desire to make commentary beyond the usual. Just a few of the common special circumstances, with brief examples of how some writers handled them, are discussed below.

=== Defining Terms That May be Misunderstood

Since your recommendation letter is almost always read outside of your school, there are cases where you should define briefly any terms specific to your school, the name and role of a group, or even terms that might be unfamiliar to your audience. At my undergraduate program—Juniata College in PA—the term “program of emphasis” rather than “major” is still used, and explaining the distinction, noting that the program of emphasis allows students to design a major course of study to suit their needs, might be necessary in a letter endorsing the student’s course choices. At Harvard, the term “tutor” could mean a small seminar instructor, a thesis supervisor, or an academic dormitory supervisor (3).

Also, be sure to write out the names for a relevant course you teach that might otherwise sound like an alphabet soup. “OPMGT 418W” might mean little to an outside reader, but a description of the course as a capstone writing-intensive class in operations management educates letter readers about the course’s contribution to the student’s credentials.

=== Recommending While Discussing Shortcomings in Grades

Especially if you’d like to discuss a student’s inconsistent academic record—which is sometimes better done by the faculty member than by the student—straightforwardness and a movement towards positive endorsement can be very effective. Such commentary usually only comes after a frank discussion with the student, of course, in which you specifically ask permission to discuss the student’s grades so that you may give context to them. One such commentary in a recommendation letter follows:

#quote()[
  In his high school, John did not have the sufficient background needed to prepare him for the rigors of college. His transition to Mythic University was not an easy one. In fact, in his first math course and chemistry lab, he received a D and a C, respectively. However, this did not send him fleeing to a major that he perceived would be easier; instead, his resolve was strengthened. He has since sought out tutorial resources to assist him and is now showing steady improvement in his grades, having just earned his first B+ in a college chemistry course and a 2.9 GPA for the most recent semester. Although John does not present the credentials of a scholar, his intent, passion, and motivation are genuine, and his progress is measurable.
]

=== Recommending the Under-Represented Student

For students under-represented in a field, the social and academic challenges can be both specific and subtle, a fact honored by scholarships sometimes earmarked for these students. The paragraph that follows—authored by the school’s Diversity Officer, which helps to lend it authority—is excerpted from a letter used to recommend a student for a minority scholarship in her field.

#quote()[
  In the fields of science and engineering, students of color and thus professionals of color remain under-represented. This under-representation can result in a lack of faculty role models, peers of color in the classroom and laboratory, and often in an isolation that inhibits full participation in the university community. Despite these difficulties, however, some students strive and thrive as Janet Lerner has done. The commitment and scholarship of a student such as Janet must be celebrated.
]

=== Recommending by Citing Others

In the case that follows, the faculty member agreed to write a letter despite limited knowledge of the student, and revealed this in the opening paragraph.

#quote()[
  I have only worked with John Lerner for one semester, in that he was originally brought into our program two years ago by my predecessor, who is currently the Director of Academic Advising in another program at Mythic University. When I contacted her for her evaluation of John, she was swift and overwhelmingly positive in her response, stating that “He is a diligent and memorable student committed to scholarship.” She went on to say that she felt great reward and satisfaction in John’s growing accomplishments.
]

=== Recommending While Acknowledging Limitations

As promoted strongly in Chapter 1 of this manual, faculty can effectively recommend students even while acknowledging areas where growth is needed. An example follows:

#quote()[
  One way for me to comment on Janet’s maturity, motivation, and performance in my class is to discuss her final paper, a proposal arguing for the creation of a new school district in her local area. Using maps, basic spatial analysis, and newspaper articles local to her area, Janet wrote a mock proposal to a school board that was professional and truly worthy of the board's attention. Her paper went far beyond the scope of the assignment, and also reflected something I noted throughout the semester: her natural ability with language. Janet has a creative, confident, maturing voice as a writer. Although she did not receive an A in my course because her grades were not consistently high, her last two papers and some one-on-one meetings with her persuaded me that she can become an effective contributor to her chosen field of sociology.
]

=== Recommending the Student Who has Since Graduated

In the example below, when asked to write a recommendation letter for a student three years after he had graduated, the faculty member solicited the student’s input and was able to write an updated letter based on the documentation provided, rehearsing and connecting the student’s undergraduate record to his present path.

#quote()[
  John has always been an academic standout. As I consider the types of academic projects in which John involved himself as an undergraduate—from his work in a sediment sampling lab to his active participation in a upper-level class in which he performed a field study of sea grass health—I am genuinely impressed by his drive, motivation, and the clarity of his vision for the future. The fact that John also won a prestigious Udall Scholarship (a national competition for students in the sciences) and received numerous other academic awards underscores his excellent undergraduate record. Since John has been in graduate school over the past three years, he has communicated with me once a year via e-mail, articulating clear professional goals in relation to his research on Southern New England salt marshes, discussing his presentation to the CT Coastal Audubon Society’s Open Space Inventory Steering Committee, and emphasizing his vision to work in estuary research and policy.

Write a Recommendation Letter
We offer content and formatting tips for writing recommendation letters. Take a look at our Career Center examples of recommendation letters for more details and advice.
Purpose of Recommendation Letters
A letter of recommendation is “expert testimony” to a student’s ability to perform a task: contributing to a team project, succeeding in graduate school, or learning from a particular experience (such as foreign study/travel). You need to be confident of the applicant’s ability to be able to write convincingly. You could put your professional credibility at risk if you consistently write letters for applicants who are not qualified.

Recommendation Letters for Graduate School Applicants
For graduate school, there is a kind of “code” for levels of confidence. Letter writers use these phrases at the beginning or end of the letter to express their professional evaluation. Generally speaking, there are four levels of confidence as suggested by graduate school forms themselves:

Strongly recommend - You are very confident in the applicant’s ability.
Recommend - You are confident in applicant’s ability.
Recommend with reservations - You are somewhat confident, but have specific areas of doubt. Include an explanation.
Do not recommend - You do not believe in applicant’s ability to succeed. Include an explanation.
Types of Recommendation Letters
Very often, academic programs ask the applicant to provide two to three letters from field-specific experts and one letter speaking to their character. Job applicants usually rely solely on field expertise, except at the beginning of their careers, when character references are all they’ve got.

Field Specific/Expert – Written by an industry expert within the applicant’s field. For instance, a science professor might provide specific feedback on a future scientist’s likelihood of success in the field.
Character/Non-Expert – Usually written by someone who is outside or on the fringe of the applicant’s industry. 
Comments on traits the applicant possesses that could lead to success.
Often written by supervisors or outside professors.
Should only come from someone who is qualified to make an informed recommendation.
Tips for Successful Recommendation Letters
A letter of recommendation succeeds on the same merits as any form of persuasive writing: good vocabulary, solid essay structure, appropriate content, and relevant details.

Vocabulary – use strong, vivid language in both nouns and verbs.
Essay Structure – Structure the letter as a four-to-five-paragraph essay with a thesis.
The first paragraph should state how long writer has known applicant, in what context, and general “thesis” statement regarding applicant’s abilities/suitability for position.
The main body should provide two or three examples or qualities that inspire confidence (or lack of confidence) in the applicant’s skills or character.
Conclude with an explicit level of recommendation (strongly/highly, recommend, recommend with reservations [must provide explanation], do not recommend [must provide explanation]).
Appropriate Content – Avoid exaggeration or speculation outside of your knowledge base.
Details – Include a few well-chosen examples of why you recommend this individual. The examples should be obviously within your sphere of knowledge.
Format of Recommendation Letters
These are official documents and should be written using the following professional/business format:

On professional or organizational letterhead
Appropriate addressing
Block flush-left paragraphs
Appropriate greetings and closings
11 pt. font
One to two pages long
*/

== Avoiding Irrelevancies

It is surprising how much irrelevant detail some letters of recommendation include, and just how much this can hurt the candidate. Consider this excerpt from a letter written in the medical field (4), in which the letter author goes into an inappropriate level of detail about a candidate’s medical problems:

#quote()[
  Her last years in my laboratory were impacted by serious health problems that have fortunately gone away—she had really debilitating problems with a herniated disk that apparently was a paraneoplastic phenomenon that went away once an early carcinoma of the left ovary was identified and removed.
]

Here the detail is not just absurdly clinical in context, but discriminatory and potentially damaging. A generous reader might interpret that the writer is well-meaning—intending to explain, perhaps, a long number of years in a lab or a weak publication record—but many would interpret that the writer actually intends to do harm. Whatever the case here, clearly the detail presented is highly irrelevant. Several studies suggest that letters often reveal more about the idiosyncrasies of the writer than the characteristics of the applicant (5,6,7), and that letter readers certainly do attend to irrelevancies when reading, in some cases over-relying on them when making decisions (8). These irrelevancies might be about either the letter writer or candidate, and either way harm can be done. When writing letters, avoid providing details that are unimportant to the selection process and may only distract or puzzle the audience. Common irrelevancies in letters include commentary about the student’s personal life or health, digressive discussions of ideology, events, or research beyond the audience’s needs, vague examples or claims that simply go unexplained, or a focus on the letter writer’s personality or beliefs that ultimately doesn't matter to the reader anyway.
