== Introduction

Consider these two excerpts from letters of recommendation:

#quote()[
  I am of the distinct opinion that his breadth and depth of knowledge and his intellectual capacity augur such a level of grandeur that he seems almost predisposed to high achievement.
]

#quote()[
  He is smart and bound to succeed.
]

Both sentences say essentially the same thing, but in different styles—the first with the luxuriance of Faulkner; the second with the parsimony of Hemingway.

Most recommendation letter writers fall somewhere between these two extremes, making sure that their diction and tone reflect their attitude towards the student even as they reveal their stylistic talents and traits as a writer. One can say that letters of recommendation have a common style in that they have a common purpose and share common phrasings, but the best writers aim to produce a letter that is nearly as individual as the student.

This chapter explores some of the stylistic categories we can choose from as we polish our prose while recommending students. Of course, as one composes a letter the issues discussed are naturally and tightly interwoven. The best writers express themselves in a way that is not artificial nor formulaic, but fluid and intuitive, and the best letters of reference characterize the student clearly while remaining true to the author’s style and standards. Most importantly, the goal is to write in a style that is natural both for you and for the circumstances of the letter, while ultimately uplifting and honoring the student you are recommending.

Why write a letter of recommendation?
Letters of recommendation are often used by an organization's hiring officials to gather additional information
about a candidate. It is assumed that a letter of recommendation will provide a candid viewpoint of an applicant's
abilities and professional promise. The letter of recommendation should give a picture of the candidate's personal
characteristics, performance and experience, strengths, capabilities, and professional promise from someone who
has worked closely with the candidate. The employer's selection committee relies on these letters to assist in
making a final decision.
When not to write a letter of recommendation.
There are several reasons to refuse a request to write a letter of recommendation. You may not know the applicant
well enough, you may not have time to write it by the time the applicant needs it, you may not feel you could say
good things about the applicant, etc. You need to be honest with the applicant about your reasons. If it is lack of
knowledge, perhaps a conversation could give you enough information, or the time frame might be negotiable. If
you feel you can't write a good letter, it is vital for the applicant to clearly hear why. This can be an opportunity
for growth and a "reality check" for the applicant. It is difficult to say no, but if done with grace and tact, it can
be quite productive for the applicant in the "long run." 


What to write?
Preferably, the person writing the letter of recommendation has been in a supervisory or mentor relationship with
the applicant. The letter should be about one page in length, and generally consist of three parts: the opening, the
body, and the closing.
Letters of Recommendation
The Writer's Perspective
Opening: The writer should explain the relationship between himself/herself and the candidate as well
as why the letter is being written. Were you a supervisor? President of the company? Advisor? Professor? It is important to indicate this because a professor may see the academic skills while a supervisor
may be able to identify work habits.
Body: The body of the recommendation should provide specific information about the applicant based
upon the observations of the writer. Information may include: 1) personal characteristics such as poise,
confidence, dependability, patience, creativity, etc.; 2) specific areas of strength or special experiences/projects on which they work; and 3) how they work with other people, etc. The applicant may
have some exceptional strengths such as a very high energy level or excellent communication skills.
An applicant may also have a specific area of knowledge or experience such as a strong background in
science, an undergraduate degree in another area or related work experience in education, a research
project, coaching, extracurricular activities, etc.
Closing: The closing of the letter should briefly summarize previous points and clearly state that you
recommend the candidate for employment (or graduate school, etc.). Finally, you may provide your
contact information in case the recipient would want to contact you directly.

The Meeting
Meeting with the applicant can yield a great deal of information. You should be inquiring (they should be telling
you) about what this letter will be used for, in general (ie. employment, graduate school, scholarships, etc.). The
applicant should also supply you with information regarding their relevant skills, experiences, abilities, strengths,
qualities and qualifications - anything that will help you write the letter. Have the person give you a list of accomplishments, organizations that he/she belongs to, or any other relevant information. It might surprise you to
see how much that person has done outside of your contact with them. This can also help you get a more accurate
picture of the individual. Having the person give you a copy of his/her resume is an easy way to have this information at hand. You have to find out what sets the applicant apart from the "average." The more informed you
are, the higher quality the letter and the quicker and easier it will be to write it. A simple question "Why should I
write you a letter?" can be enough to get the conversation started.
Important Points To Keep In Mind
1. Give honest and factual information. The letter should not include anything you are not willing to defend in
public. Employers often skim the letter and pick up the phone and ask you pointed questions about what you wrote
and how the applicant specifically could benefit their organization.
2. Concentrate on several different aspects of the applicant. Specifically identify his/her skills, attitudes, personal
attributes and growth, as well as his/her contributions to and performance within your organization. It is extremely
important to include examples where possible. It is one thing to state that someone had some good ideas and another
to say, "John consistently used his creativity in designing eye-catching promotional materials which translated
into higher numbers of residents attending his programs." Also, if you do make negative comments, back them
up with facts.
3. The appearance of a letter is a reflection on both you and the candidate and it can also determine whether it will
be read or not. Please type your recommendation neatly. You may want to keep a copy on computer for future
updates.
4. If you are using a standard recommendation form, please do not restrict your reference to the space provided.
Feel free to use office letterhead or stationery.
5. Don't reference characteristics that can be the basis of discrimination, such as race, color, nationality, gender,
religion, age, appearance, any handicapping condition, marital or parental status, or political point of view. In
cases where an applicant's strengths or involvement might reveal potential controversial or sensitive information
(ie. President of BiGala) you will need to closely work with the applicant to determine their comfort level in terms
of what you write.
6. The letter should include a reachable phone number for the writer. Keep a copy and expect a call (some HR
officers believe that they can get a more authentic "read" of recommendations by phone. It's not necessarily true,
but they do call). Not remembering what you wrote could reflect poorly on your credibility and the candidate.

Confidential vs. Non-Confidential Letters
Ask the applicant if this letter will be confidential or non-confidential; it is a collaborative decision. If it will be
confidential, you will need to send the letter directly to the organization to which they are applying or the Career
Services office if they have opened a credentials file. *Some employers (traditional organizations like banks, or
educational institutions) prefer confidential letters; the rest are about equally divided in regards to which type they
prefer. We recommend that confidential letters be prepared on Career Services reference forms.

Beware of the power of words! Some words seem harmless
in every day conversation, but carry positive or negative
connotations to a prospective employer.
Avoid bland words such as:
 • nice • good • fairly • reasonable • decent • satisfactory •various
Powerful words which are appropriate to use include:
• articulate • effective • sophisticated • intelligent • observant • significant
• expressive • creative • efficient • cooperative • imaginative • assertive
• dependable • mature • innovative • outstanding • proficient • energetic

Being asked to write a letter of recommendation can be flattering, but also daunting if you don't know what to say. How to write a letter of recommendation will guide you through the basic structure of a letter as well as give you some suggestions as content, tips on how to write it, examples of recommendation letters and even tell you how and when not to write a letter of recommendation letter.

Letter of Recommendation Tips
Get as much information about the person beforehand.
Use standard business letter format for the letter.
Your first paragraph should state some background information.
Include specific information in the body of the letter.
Don't use vague words.
Proofread the letter before sending it.
Introduction
If you have been asked by someone to write a letter of recommendation, your first thought may be "what do I say?" The content within different letters of recommendation will vary greatly depending on who wrote the letter and the reason the letter was written. However, the basic structure is typically the same.



What You'll Need
If you agree to write a letter of recommendation for someone, you will want to make it as easy on yourself as possible. Therefore, you should obtain some information from the person before you start writing. These things can include:
The person's full name, address, e-mail and telephone number.
When the letter is due.
The name and address of the person or institution the letter is for. (If applicable.)
A resume or curriculum vitae.
Two copies of any forms they need to be included with the letter.1
A list of activities, awards, accomplishments and achievements.1
For academic situations: the person's GPA, courses taken or transcript, and a paper or exam from your course.2 3
A description of the person's goals.4
Any outside service activities that he or she has participated in.2
The reason the letter is needed.5
A list of the different ways you have interacted (for school and work settings).5
Things that the person would like you to address in the letter.4
Any other information that you feel will make the process easier.5
Parts of a Letter of Recommendation
There are different styles you can use with your letter of recommendation. This page will cover both the block and modified block styles. They are very similar except that in the modified block style the date, inside address and closing begin at the center of the page instead of at the left hand margin.6 In the block style, all elements are aligned on the left.7 Paragraphs are not indented for either style.8
Heading
The heading includes your return address, the date, the recipient's address and the salutation.
You will only need to include a return address if you are not using personalized stationary. Your return address goes above and should be aligned with the date.6
An empty line should be placed between the date and the recipient's address.8
The salutation should be "Dear (Person's Name)" and end with a colon.7 If you do not know the person's name, write "To Whom it May Concern."
Opening Statement
The first paragraph is where you should explain your relationship to the person you are recommending. In doing so, you should establish the following points:
The person the letter is about.5
Who you are.3
Your relationship to the person (teacher, employer, friend, etc.).9
How well you know the person.10 Include information on how long you have known them and how often you met with them.4
A brief statement regarding your overall opinion of the person.5
Body
What you include in the body of the letter can vary widely. However, you want to include as much specific information and examples as you can. Examples can come from projects, papers, events and any experiences you had with the individual.5 It can be as short as one paragraph or extend into several paragraphs.10 Here is a list of different things you could include in the body:
An evaluation of the individual based on your experiences.5
An explanation of why he or she is qualified.10
Explain how the person's academic skills might translate into other areas.5
State the person's professional qualifications along with examples from specific accomplishments.11
Explain how the person's character would apply to the position (without mentioning anything that could be the basis of discrimination).11
Discuss specific likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses, energy level, motivation, areas of talent and challenge, plus any unusual contributing factors.5
What he or she can contribute to the facility.10
How the person's skills match what they are applying for.10
How the applicant is better suited than others with similar backgrounds.11
Explain any weaknesses in the person's record.3
Other things you might mention in your letter include:
Consistency of performance/Reliability: shows initiative, dependable
Communication skills: articulate, expressive,
Character traits: self-confident, intelligent, highly responsible, mature, sophisticated
Team skills: cooperative, observant, assertive
Work style: efficient, innovative, creative, imaginative, self directed, effective, energetic4
Closing
Your last paragraph should summarize what has been said and include contact information. Then, you should end the letter with a complimentary closing, your signature, and your name and title typed.
Restate your overall recommendation.9
Provide ways for the person to contact you if they need additional information.11 This can include your email address, home or cell phone number.4
Your complimentary should be short and polite. It should be located at the left margin or with it's left edge in the center of the page.12
Capitalize only the first word of the complimentary close (such as "Best wishes") and follow it with a comma.8
Include your title with your signature.9
Overall Writing Tips
Here are some basic tips on things to do and not to do when writing recommendation letters:
Type your letter on business letterhead.13
Get a signed written consent form before releasing any personal information about the student such as GPA, grades, social security number, etc.14
Avoid stating personal opinions or feelings unless you can give specific explanations for those statements.14
Don't include secondhand information.13
Don't use vague words such as good, fine, nice or reasonable.
Proofread your letter.15
Although there are no rules on how long a letter of recommendation can be, keep your letter brief and to the point.9 15
Keep copies of every letter you send.13

Choosing Not to Write the Letter
There may be times you are asked to write someone a letter of recommendation for someone that you would rather not recommend or don't feel you can recommend. If faced with this situation, your best bet is to tell the person you can't write a letter for him or her.
Only write letters for people that you know.16
Don't be afraid to say no if you don't have the time to write the letter.9
Be upfront with how strong your letter will be.13
A vague or dishonest letter can actually do more harm than good.15
Conclusion
While it might seem like a burden, writing a letter of recommendation for someone gives you the opportunity to help another person pursue their goals and ambitions. Therefore, it is important that you put enough of an effort into it to be an asset and not a detriment to that person.


Write a Letter of Recommendation
Writing letters of recommendation for students applying to graduate schools and to jobs can be a difficult and time-consuming task for professors or other university personnel. Students may request a letter written to a specific school or job, OR, they may request a general “To Whom It May Concern” letter. Please use departmental letterhead for either of these.

You may want to request specific information from the student in order to write the letter. Some of the things you could ask for are:

A current resume
Some academic information such as copies of transcripts or list of courses completed.
An explanation of the student’s career goals or type of job or graduate school he/she hopes to enter. (This could be requested in writing or in an individual meeting with you.)
Any ideas the student has on what he/she would like you to address in the letter.
A phone number and address of where the student can be reached.
A deadline for when the letter is needed.
Some faculty develop a form they give to students that requests this information. You may find that the qualities and skills that might predict potential success in graduate school would be different than those for a job, so letters of recommendations for jobs may differ from those for graduate school.

Tell the student how you feel about writing a letter for him/her. If you do not feel you could provide a thorough enough or positive enough letter on the student, let him/her know that when the request is made. If you do write anything that is negative in a letter, you should provide evidence for your statements.

The following outline may provide helpful information in determining what to include in a letter of recommendation:

Explain Your Contact with the Applicant
Letters should make clear how well you know the applicant. How many courses has the student had from you? Did you have contact with the applicant outside of class?
Personal Attributes
The letter should attempt to give insight into the student’s personal qualities and his/her interactions with others. Emphasis should be placed on characteristics that indicate special promise or potential problems in the field. The letter could address some of these questions: What first stimulated the applicant’s interest in the field? How well does the applicant organize his/her thoughts and communicate them? What evidence is there of his/her judgement, reliability, organizational ability and analytical skills?
Academic Achievement
Comments may be made which amplify information on academic transcripts such as: a) Consistency of performance. Was the student consistent or are there certain anomalies that can be described? b) Extenuating circumstances that might account for atypical grades or course loads, such as illness, employment or extensive extracurricular involvement. c) Degree of difficulty of individual classes and overall course loads e.g., upper division courses taken during freshman year, or especially advanced classes.
Employment/Extracurricular Activities
Since these are listed on most applications, mention them only if you can elaborate meaningfully on them. Activities that indicate motivation for advanced study are of special interest. If involvement was extensive, what was the effect on academic achievement?
Honors Received, Academic or Non-Academic
Explain what achievement the honor represents. Specify the competition or degree of selectivity of such awards.
Overall Evaluation
It is very helpful to make a value judgement, which is an overall appraisal of the applicant’s potential. This evaluation should be based on all the attributes of the applicant, not merely academic performance. Maybe explain how this student compares to other students.
Schools and employers appreciate specific examples or evidence to back up what was said in the letter. The letter should place emphasis on the student’s skills, abilities and experience that fit the requirements of the position or graduate school program. Do not include information that might indicate the individual’s race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender or marital status, UNLESS it is relevant to the position for which he/she is applying and you’ve discussed it with the student. (For example, if the student is applying for a position in which having a multicultural background would be an asset in carrying out the duties of the job.)

If you are willing to receive calls from employers or schools requesting further information on the applicant, you could include your business phone or home phone, and/or email, in the letter.

Most letters for employment are one page and most letters for graduate school are 1 – 2 pages. Please give the student an approximate time when the letter will be available.

The appearance of the letter is a reflection on both you and the candidate. Typed letters are strongly recommended, with careful proofreading.

Some words/phrases that have impact in letters include:

articulate
effective
sophisticated
self-confident
intelligent
observant
significant
highly responsible
expressive
creative
efficient
shows initiative
cooperative
imaginative
assertive
energetic
dependable
mature
innovative
self directed


GSAS GUIDE FOR TEACHING FELLOWS ON WRITING LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
by Cynthia Verba

WRITING LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO TEACHING
Writing letters of recommendation is a skill that will be of great importance throughout your teaching career, and perhaps should be viewed as an almost integral part of your teaching experience. Students in your sections or tutorials who have had a positive experience - in terms of what they have learned, or the work they have produced - are likely to come to you for a letter of recommendation. Indeed, an abundance of requests can be taken as an indication that you are a good teacher and have an ability to establish a rapport with your students. In our view, good letter writers deserve considerable recognition for the contribution that they make. (If you have written a large number of letters, you might even consider making a note of that when asked by a potential hiring department about your teaching skills and responsibilities.)

THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
l. In simplest terms, a letter of recommendation is a letter that makes a statement of support for a candidate. If, after doing a careful review of a candidate's strengths and weaknesses, you cannot write a supportive letter, it is important to have a candid discussion with the student.

2. Beyond that simple definition, a letter of recommendation should also present a well-documented evaluation, providing sufficient evidence and information to help a selection committee in making its decision.

3. A letter of recommendation should also address the specific purpose for which it is written - although you will also receive requests from many students for a general letter for their House file, in anticipation of eventual applications. For most applications, a letter of recommendation will need to discuss both scholarly capabilities and personal character - although the balance between the two will vary, depending upon the nature of the application. For example, at one end of the scale, a letter for an applicant for graduate study in the arts and sciences should focus primarily on the scholarly, while at the other end, a letter for an applicant for a non-academic position should discuss a broader range of qualities and experiences - including extracurricular or work experience as well. As a further example of matching a letter with its purpose, a letter for an applicant for a fellowship with a specific project should discuss the validity and feasibility of the project, as well as the candidate's qualifications for fulfilling the project. The letter should pay close attention to the language of the fellowship announcement.

If you have any questions about the criteria for a specific application, consult the appropriate specialists - for example, those who do pre-law, medical, business or fellowship advising at the Office of Career Services or in the Harvard Houses.

4. A letter of recommendation can also be used to explain some weakness or ambiguity in a student's record. If appropriate - and probably after consulting the student - you might wish to mention a family illness, financial hardship, or other factor.

5. For the content of a well-documented letter, the following are further suggestions (see also the samples in the final section):

a. You should promptly identify yourself and the basis of your knowledge of the student: Were you a Teaching Fellow in a tutorial or small seminar for department concentrators? How often did it meet, how many students? how many papers? Do you also know the student through exposure as a House Tutor, or some other capacity? Has your acquaintance been sustained over a number of years? Writing the letter on department letterhead is a further form of identification.

b. In evaluating a student's intellectual capabilities, try to describe the student in terms that reflect that student's distinctive or individual strengths. Whatever strengths strike you as particularly salient, be prepared to back up your judgement with concrete examples - papers, exams, class presentations, or performance in a laboratory.

Above all, avoid the misconception that the more superlatives that you use, the stronger the letter. Heavy use of stock phrases or cliches in general is unhelpful. Your letter can only be effective if it contains substantive information about the student's qualifications.

c. Ranking the student may be requested or desired by selection committees. Having concentrated on the student's individual or unique strengths, you might find it difficult to do so. Ranking is of course less of a problem if a student is unambiguously among the top five or ten percent that you have taught, or so outstanding that he or she would safely rank high in any group. Many of the students who come to you for a letter, however, will not fall within that small unambiguous group. If you wish to offer some comparative perspective, you might be more readily able to do so in more specific areas: Is the student one of the most articulate? original? clear-thinking? motivated? intellectually curious? Some schools or fellowships have forms which ask for rankings broken down into specific areas.

If you lack sufficient information to answer some questions posed or suggested in an application, it is best to maintain the integrity and credibility of your letter, and say only what you are in a position to say.

d. In discussing a student's character, proceed in a similar fashion to the intellectual evaluation, highlighting individual traits and providing concrete illustrations.

e. After discussing each of the above points, your letter should have some brief summation, giving the main thrust of your recommendation for the candidate.

 

HOW TO ACQUIRE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO WRITE AN EFFECTIVE LETTER
Meeting with the Student
Even if you know a student very well, the process of writing an effective letter can be greatly facilitated if you arrange to have an interview with the student, using this as an opportunity to discuss the student's goals - short-term and long - and to acquire more precise information in any area where it is needed.

Obtaining Written Materials
As you arrange a meeting with a student, you should also ask the student to bring the following items:

1) a resume or curriculum vitae,

2) a paper or an exam written for your course,

3) a copy of the application essay or fellowship statement of purpose

4) a transcript

5) any literature that describes the fellowship or program for which the student is applying; specific recommendation forms or questionnaires if they are provided for the letter writer to complete

6) the date on which the recommendation is due, as well as the address - preferably an addressed envelope to which it must be sent

7) a waiver form (obtained by the student from the House Senior Tutor), indicating whether or not the student waives his or her right to see the letter of recommendation. If the student has any questions about this decision, you might point out that there are important benefits in maintaining the confidentiality of letters. Selection committees, for example, tend to view confidential letters as having greater credibility and assign them greater weight; also, some letter writers actually feel less inhibited in their praise of students in confidential letters. While making these points, be sure to make it clear that it is up to the student to decide.

One other factor that greatly facilitates letter writing is if you can write a letter as soon as possible after you have taught a student, while your impressions are still vivid and fresh. You might consider encouraging students to make their requests early, rather than waiting until senior year or beyond. These early letters can be placed in the students' House files, as well as maintained in your own files for future reference.

FURTHER REFINEMENTS: HANDLING THE EASIEST CASE, THE IN-BETWEEN CASE, AND THE MOST DIFFICULT CASE
The written materials listed above and a discussion with the student will greatly benefit the letter writing process - and indeed, the application process - although in each case it will benefit in a different way. The following are possible scenarios:

The easiest case: A request is made by a student you know very well, have seen in different settings - classroom and House - and whose performance and conduct you find to be consistently outstanding. In this case, you can use the discussion and written materials not only to further refine your own presentation of the student, but to help the student refine the application - and especially the application essay. Many students find it difficult to talk about themselves - even the most articulate. By drawing the student out, asking for further elaboration or more specific details, you can help bring into sharper focus such items as past accomplishments, future plans, or why the student is making this particular application.

The in-between case: A request is made by a student who has made some favorable impression, but you lack considerable information to write a well-documented letter. The benefits of the interview and acquiring written materials are most obvious in this instance. In addition to allowing you to do all of the above, they will allow you to fill in gaps in your knowledge and to gain a clearer view of the candidate. It is particularly helpful for students who tend to be somewhat shy or quiet in class. What you may not have learned about the student in the classroom, you may be able to learn through a discussion that specifically addresses matters that you need to know.

The most difficult case: A request is made by a student who has made no impression, or only a negative impression. In this case, it is extremely important to be both candid and helpful at the same time. One of the things a discussion can accomplish is to give the student a thorough hearing before you decide whether or not you can provide support. If you still find that there is little that you can say in support, you might help the student to identify a more appropriate letter writer, and also explore whether the student is making an appropriate application.

Such a discussion offers an important teaching and advising opportunity - one that may be sorely needed. The student who comes to you for a letter that you cannot write may have a similar problem with other instructors. It is important to discuss with the student how he or she might improve prospects for the future. Above all, it is important to avoid allowing the student to believe that all opportunities have been permanently closed. Try to emphasize the student's potential strengths - perhaps asking the student to share with you a favorite paper or other positive experience that may have occurred outside of your class. The message to convey is that there are constructive steps to be taken, and that if the student has gained a clearer understanding of his or her strengths and weaknesses, then this marks an important first step.

QUESTIONS OF FORMAT AND STYLE, CO-SIGNED LETTERS
In some applications, the format is determined by the application itself: the recommender is asked to answer a series of questions. If a form does not allow you to say everything that you would like to say, it is appropriate to attach additional remarks. Indeed, it is common practice to attach a full letter of recommendation to a form, in addition to responding to questions on the form. Furthermore, if a form asks for information that you cannot provide, it is best to say so. The following are further considerations:

l. The length of a letter: If you follow the above guide-lines, your letter probably will be somewhere between one and two pages. Anything longer than three pages is counter-productive, since readers normally have a quantity of letters to read. On the other hand, anything shorter than a page may imply a lack of interest or knowledge about the student.

2. The care with which you write the letter: This will also influence the effectiveness of the letter. Writing in your best polished prose style is another way of registering your support for the student.

3. Clarification of terms peculiar to Harvard: Terms such as "Tutorial" require some explanation. It may mean that you taught the student in a small seminar, or perhaps you provided individual supervision for the student's thesis. Similarly, if your primary contact with the student is through your role as a House Tutor, it is important to explain that role. It may be useful to clarify that the Harvard Houses are more than dormitories and that they perform academic functions as well.

4. Writing the letter on a word-processor: If possible, do so, and be sure to save the file. Once you have been asked by a student to write a letter, that student may return again and again, over a large number of years, for additional letters. A word-processor allows you to adapt and up-date an original letter with considerable ease. It is a way of protecting your initial investment in time and effort.

5. To whom to address the letter: If a student is applying to similar programs in a number of different schools, your letter can be left virtually unchanged for each application. In this case, addressing the letter "To whom it may concern" will facilitate this multiple use. This is also useful if a student is simply asking for a letter for his or her House file, in anticipation of eventual applications. For medical school applications, the letter should be addressed "To the Admissions Committee." In the case of letters for specific fellowships, each letter should address the appropriate fellowship committee, and make any other adjustments in the letter that may be necessary.

It should be noted that in some cases, letters of recommendation are submitted to a campus representative, rather than sent directly to a selection committee. The Fulbright Grant is one example; medical schools also require an intermediary, or a composite letter from a Dean. These variations are steps taken after you have produced your letter, and need not affect the process we describe in this guide for writing letters. One other possibility is that the student requests a letter of recommendation for the House file, in anticipation of future applications. The advantage of this early request is that you are asked to write while you still have the student's performance freshly in mind and can write a more vivid letter. Be sure that the student fully informs you as to the purpose and destination of your letter.

6. The issue of gender: In the past, it was common for letter writers to make distinctions in the way they described women versus men. Descriptions often paid greater attention to the personal lives or personal characteristics of women than men, focusing on items that had little proper place or relevance in a letter of recommendation. While this problem has greatly improved, it is still important to remain sensitive to this issue.

7. Co-signing Letters with Senior Faculty: Students at Harvard at times find that all of their potential letter writers - i.e., the teachers who know them best - are graduate students, rather than professors, since graduate students are mainly the ones who teach small sections and tutorials. In most cases, it is important for applications to include at least one letter from a member of the Faculty. If a student in your section is in this situation, you can propose to have the letter co-signed. This would probably require that you prepare a draft of the letter, share it with the course Professor, share as well written materials provided by the student, and also arrange for a meeting between the student and the Professor. (Some of these steps take place in any case as a normal part of course procedure.)

SAMPLE LETTERS (with modifications and deletions in order to preserve anonymity)
SAMPLE A
"I first knew X in the spring of l986 when she was a member of my Freshman Seminar, '. . . .` In such small groups teacher and students come to know one another in a way that is seldom, if ever, possible in large lecture courses. In either forum something can be learned about a student's academic ability, but only in the former can one get a reliable measure of the student as a person. . . . Having kept in touch with X in the intervening years, I am confident in my knowledge of her.

To begin with, she is an excellent student, with a lively curiosity that makes her dissatisfied with superficial explanations. That curiosity frequently led our seminar down avenues and into areas that, otherwise, would have remained unexplored. . . .

One has only to speak to her to recognize her openness and eagerness. It is easy to mistake this for naivete, an error I made when she first told me she had signed up to be an apprentice teacher in one of Boston's more notorious inner city high schools. . . . Throughout the term, often at great cost to her own peace of mind, and sometimes in explicit conflict with the regular teacher, she continued to insist on a high level of performance from her students. She not only survived the term but won the admiration and respect of students accustomed to being patronized by teachers content to believe that nothing much can be expected.

I would expect X to bring these same qualities of character to . . . . That is, an openness to new places, peoples, cultures and customs; a keen intelligence, with which to analyze and order her experience; irrepressible curiosity; and an unusual ability for dealing with people of all ages and conditions. Those qualities, combined with her toughness of character. . ., will enable her to understand and empathize with others while never losing touch with who she is."

SAMPLE B
"X has been an assistant in my laboratory during the past year, and has proven to be exceptional in several respects. First, X is exceptionally intelligent. He proved to be a very quick study, learning the elements of experimental design and the uses of microcomputers in record time. Furthermore, his questions are always thoughtful and penetrating. X threw himself into his assigned projects wholeheartedly, and shows every sign of having real talent in . . . . I was a little surprised by his high degree of enthusiasm because I knew that X was not primarily interested in . . . . When I mentioned this to him, I discovered that he has well defined career goals that mesh with the projects he was working on . . . .

Second, X is exceptionally diligent and hard working. He worked many extra hours over the summer. I vividly recall coming into the lab late in the evening. . . and finding X at work. X invariably finished projects well in advance of our projected target date. X was always cheerful during this intense period, and was a joy to have in the lab.

Third, X is very good at working with other people. He is exceptionally nice and considerate and sensitive. X is not only good humored and friendly, but also is good at gauging other people's level of knowledge and attitudes. . . .

All in all, I think X has a very bright future, and I am sure that he would benefit from . . . . Given his great intelligence and sensitivity, I am sure that he could put . . . to good use.

In short, I give X my highest recommendation, and very much hope that the committee judges his application favorably."

SAMPLE C
"I am writing in support of X to . . . . I have known X since September, l986. He was a member of a small . . . tutorial that I taught in l986-87. . . . X was an active and conscientious member of the class. He challenged the rest of the class to consider issues from new perspectives and often asked very penetrating and important questions. He chose to take on difficult topics and handled them well. His assignments were well-written, well-supported, organized, neat, and timely. It was evident that X really desired to learn more and challenge himself. . . .

X also has interest outside of academics. He has been an active member of . . . , a Harvard singing group, and a member of the campus . . . club. He is also a member of the . . . House film society. X's personality is wonderful. He is outgoing and friendly, but not dominating. He has an obvious and sincere concern for others. . . .

X would be a wonderful student to have at . . . . He has skills that he is eager to share, but he is just as eager to learn. . . . I feel very confident that he will be extremely successful in all his future endeavors. He is a focussed and determined young man. I highly recommend him for . . . ."

SAMPLE D
"I am pleased to write to you on behalf of X, who is applying for a fellowship to study . . . . I have known X for two years. She took my course in . . . . More recently, I have been advising her on her thesis.

X has done well in Harvard's . . . concentration. The concentration includes preparation in . . . . In addition, she has had substantial exposure to the "practical" aspects of her topic, for example through her work at . . . . Thus she is extremely well prepared to fulfill her proposed project.

X has selected an area, . . . , which is of growing interest. . . . In my view as someone who studies . . . among other topics, questions such as this are severely under-researched. The proposed topic - . . . - seems to be both worthwhile and feasible, and should prove very interesting.

X is an independent self-starter. While she has no trouble working in groups, or interacting with others, she can also work well on her own. Furthermore, she is mature and personable. I would expect her to perform well in a wide range of environments. In fact, her personality and skills should place her high on any list of good "representatives" for the U.S.

I hope that you will consider her application strongly."

SAMPLE E
"This letter is in support of X, who is applying for a . . . grant. I have read his statement of purpose with great care; in fact, I have had many discussions with him about his project, which I find both compelling and important.

X is a rare combination: he is already at this young age a seasoned expert in both literature and iconography . . . . Having taught him in a language-intensive course last year, I can bear witness to his superb command of German . . . .

His project's focus of interest, the . . . , is admirably suited to someone of X's talents and industry. The . . . Institute is the ideal place to carry out such research, and I am confident that X`s discoveries will in the long run make an impact on learning in that field.

Add to all this that X is a very congenial person, well-liked by teachers and fellow-students alike, and you will see why I am so positive about this bright and energetic young scholar. I endorse his candidacy with confidence and enthusiasm."

== Common Stylistic Strategies


=== Formalities and Generic Phrases

Though some writers overuse them, formalities and generic phrases do have a place in the convention of letters of reference. Here are a few of the most popular:

#quote()[
  Ms. Janet Lerner has asked for my recommendation, and I am most happy to give it.
]

#quote()[
  I recommend him highly and without reservation.
]

Such phrases, often “bookending” the body of the letter, do no harm, but at the same time they are used so often that they become invisible and meaningless as well. A more creative and meaningful approach is to use sentences of more substance that fit the circumstances and the student directly. As examples, note two sentences that are used to end sample recommendation letters in Chapter 5:

#quote()[
  I think he would be an excellent REU candidate, and I enthusiastically endorse his application.
]

#quote()[
  She will be a rare catch for any graduate school, and I will watch her career develop with great interest and high expectations.
]

Such personalized endorsements represent the student more emphatically, with more style, and perhaps more credibly, than any generic line can.

=== The Role of Jargon and Informalities

Specialized vocabulary in a letter—assuming it’s clear in context, not overused, and audience-appropriate—can boost a letter’s impact, enhancing the writer’s credibility and lending the student’s work more value. Often, proper context has to be created for the jargon, and it’s most likely to be used within sentences where examples are provided. Considering just the example letters in Chapter 5, the recommendations written by scientists are more powerful because they comment on a student’s facility with nano-indentation techniques or mastery of quantitative RT-PCR, helping readers view the students being recommended as researchers.

Informal, anecdotal examples, colloquialisms, and even slang—used with discretion and restraint—can also help the reader feel a connection with both letter writer and the student. Again drawing from sample letters in Chapter 5, we hear of a student’s “excellent lab hands,” we find a professor noting that she competes with her student on the squash court, we are given examples of a student’s quirky and sardonic humor, and we even find a faculty member in a teaching job recommendation using an exclamation point. Such informal snapshots have the impact of helping us to know the student better, and prove that the writer knows well and genuinely admires the student.

=== Using Narrative

Using narrative can help you organize and help bring forth the student’s distinctiveness. Effective paragraphs often open with some narrative that sets a scene—“In the fall of 2009” or “I recall the time that William first came to my office to discuss. . . .”  Likewise, you might use narrative to underscore a student’s growth: “Our next contact was when Megan enrolled in my senior-level Logistics class, where I was delighted to discover her more matured perceptions on. . . .”

Some writers go so far as to open their letter with a brief narrative as a way to capture audience attention. Note this example excerpted from a letter in Chapter 5:

#quote()[
Perhaps the most memorable discussion I’ve ever had with a student about his decision to switch majors was three years ago. The student was a first-year Polymer Science and Engineering major on a scholarship, taking my introductory film class as an elective, and he told me he was considering a switch to Film. Assuming that this student was simply running into typical academic problems in first-year chemistry and physics courses, I asked how those courses were going. “Oh, I’m getting As in those,” he assured me with a calm wave of his hand. “But I long to study Film.” That student was John Lerner.
]

Beware of overuse or digressive use of narrative. Use it selectively to enhance the letter’s readability and show growth and change over the student’s career.

=== Striking the Right Tone

An ideal tone is one that suggests warm familiarity with and confidence in a student—the implication is that you approve of the student as a person and take the student seriously. Some ideas for fostering such a tone are:

- after the initial formal introduction, refer to the student by first name;
- narrate a personal interaction that took place in your office or elsewhere;
- recall your first impressions of the student, then contrast these with later ones;
- present intriguing asides such as spontaneous discussions or shared interests or backgrounds;
- describe the student’s specific contribution to your relationship;
- supply information demonstrating that you and the student have discussed career plans or graduate school.

Avoid such tonal extremes as referring to the student by last name only or excessively glorifying the student. A letter that becomes too flattering about the student or too personal in detail might actually do more harm than good.

=== Managing Persona

A touchy subject, this. We all develop particular habits as writers and often cling to them tenaciously, and when writing a letter we might think that we should produce a document either stripped of personality or one that is so personal in voice that it’s full of idiosyncrasy. Given that the persona one adopts in a letter can influence the reader’s opinion of the candidate highly, the prudent choice is to think about the student’s needs and the reader’s needs as primary and directive.

The writer’s persona should be a natural yet subdued part of any professional letter of recommendation. In an effort to add flair, it may be tempting to make clever parenthetical comments, digress, or even provide so much nifty narration that the student’s accomplishments get buried in a needlessly nimble plot. Conversely, some writers make the mistake of adopting such a clinical or artificially genteel manner that the letter might seem to have been written by a robot or a polished butler. Consider how dispassionate an employer or selection committee can become about a candidate when put off by the letter writer’s persona. I’ve been on selection committees where the members were openly judgmental of and distracted by the letter writer’s style, and thus the focus became on the writer’s quirks rather than the candidate’s strengths.

The bottom line is that your voice should suit the situation first and you second. Write with a persona that will humanize both you and the student, but keep the focus positively on the student, not on yourself or on the letter itself.

/*

What Makes for Strong Letters of Recommendation
What follows are responses to an informal survey of scholarship selection panel members asking: What
do you like to see in a letter of recommendation, and what leaves you cold? These comments are
pertinent to letters for most major fellowships. Of course, not every strong letter may be able to support
the applicant in each of these ways. But all strong letters provide a vivid sense of what distinguishes
the applicant and suggest a number of questions that could be the basis of a productive interview.
What helps:
• Provide specific information about the applicant—information that committee members can
use to determine the applicant’s strengths and that will help shape an interview.
• Provide some context of how the writer knows the applicant—class, research, work, civic, or
other context—and for what period of time the writer has known the applicant.
• Show that the writer knows the applicant personally. For example, incidents or actions
unique to this relationship are more credible than information that could be gathered from the
resume.
• Point to specific examples of what the applicant has done. (If the student wrote a brilliant
paper, mention its topic and why it stood out. If the student did outstanding work in another
regard, explain the nature of this work and its particular strengths, especially as they relate to the
goals of the fellowship.)
• Discuss why the applicant would be a strong candidate for the specific fellowship. How does
this candidate exemplify the personal qualities or selection criteria specified by the fellowship?
Specific examples are crucial.
• Indicate what particularly qualifies the student for the course of study or project that the
applicant is proposing. Such letters provide the links between past performance and what is
proposed.
• Place the student in a larger context. For example, a letter could compare the present applicant
to others who have applied for similar honors in the past or who have succeeded in such
competitions. If possible, the student can be compared to graduate students or professionals.
Quantitative remarks and percentages may be useful: “among the three best students I have
taught,” “top 5% of students in my 20 years of teaching.” The strongest comparisons have the
widest reach: “among the best in my x years of teaching” is stronger than “the best in his/her
section.”
• Draw on the remarks of colleagues for supporting evidence or the acknowledgement of specific
strengths. Letters from professors may also draw on the comments from teaching assistants who
may have worked more closely with the applicants.
What hurts:
o Letters that are too short, that fail to provide specific examples or instances of points mentioned.
o Generic letters or letters for another purpose sent without regard to the specific fellowship, course
of study, or project proposed.
o Letters that merely summarize information available elsewhere in the application or that only
present the student’s grade or rank in a class.
o Letters that focus too much on the context of how the writer knows the applicant (descriptions of
the course or its approaches) and not sufficiently on the student and his or her accomplishments.
o Letters that consist largely of unsupported praise. Kind words that do not give committees a
strong sense of how applicants have distinguished themselves are not helpful.
o Letters that damn with faint praise. It is not helpful to say that a student did what might be
expected (completed all the reading assignments) or that point to qualities (punctuality,
enthusiasm, presentability) not germane to the fellowship. 
o Letters that focus on experiences that happened quite a few years ago. Even letters from writers
with long standing relationships with the applicant need to be as current and forward-looking as
possible.
o Letters that may be read as implying criticism (beware of back-handed compliments) or whose
criticisms might be taken to indicate stronger reservations than stated. Letters should be honest—
and honest criticism, if generously presented, can enhance the force of a letter—but committees
take critical comments very seriously. It is best to be cautious when making critical remarks and
to avoid any sense of indirection.
Tips on formatting letters of recommendation:
• Address letters to the individual who chairs the fellowship committee, if that information is
provided, or to the committee as a whole (“Dear Marshall Scholarship Committee”).
• Make sure the letter is dated and printed on department or other appropriate letterhead.
• Letters for major fellowships are usually 1 to 2 pages single-spaced.
• Close with your signature (in a color other than black to distinguish the original from copies) and
your full title or titles (e.g., “Assistant Professor of Chemistry” rather than just “Assistant
Professor”).
Other considerations:
• You may want to ask your student who else is writing for them and what the other writers are
likely to say. You can then provide information in your letters that will complement what is
being written by others, so that together the letters will provide a more comprehensive picture of
each applicant.
• If you are called upon to write letters for two or more applicants for the same fellowship, beware
of using too much of the same language in each, especially if they will be read by the same
committee. Such repetition weakens the force of your letters. If you have questions about
whether two or more students are applying through the same state or region, please contact the
campus fellowship adviser.
• Although students are encouraged to provide recommenders with detailed information about
themselves, the fellowships, and proposed projects or courses of study, faculty should beware of
leaning too heavily on such material for their letters, since students usually give the same
information to each letter writer and following this material too closely can lead to letters that
sound too much the same.
• If you have written a letter in collaboration with another faculty member, be mindful about how
you and your colleague use subsequent versions of that letter. We want to avoid situations in
which a student is represented by different letters with largely identical language from two
different faculty members.
• When to say “No”:
o if you feel that you cannot be emphatically positive in support of a student
o if you recall little more about a student than the recorded grades
o if you think that you are not the best person to write a letter
o if a student approaches you in a highly unprofessional manner
o if you simply do not have the time or material to write a good letter for a student.
You can help the student to consider other possible letter writers, but agreeing to write for a
student whom you cannot strongly support is good for no one.
• Before meeting with students to discuss possible letters, recommend that they consult advice on
how to request a letter of recommendation: http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/FS/letters.html

== Active Verbs

One of the distinctions of effective writers is their facility with active verbs. Active verbs carry analytical meaning with efficiency, and when selectively applied to a student’s accomplishments, simplify the goal of categorizing and interpreting the kinds of merits that a student has accrued. They can also help present a student as positive and energetic, admired and respected, mature and serious. In these excerpts from sample letters in Chapter 5, note how the active verbs are used creatively and repeatedly to uplift the student:

Although Janet struggled to see her own potential earlier in her college career, encouragement from her advisor as well as her labmates, coupled with her own growing desire to succeed, transformed this once tentative student into an important contributor to the lab.

Mr. Lerner challenged his class to find multiple ways to make a bulb light using only one battery, one bulb, and one wire.

She developed a solution, built the necessary coalition, developed creative compromises, and worked through to the proposal’s enactment.

For a partial list of some of the active verbs most commonly and effectively used in recommendation letters, consult the list below.

== Transitions

As a reader, I often find that so much depends on contextual clues the writer provides. Note how the example below, excerpted from a letter in Chapter 6, consistently provides contextual clues related to time ("Over the past year . . ."), content (The NIWC is a cross-community coalition . . ."), and background ("She spent three months in Belfast . . .") about both letter writer and student.

#quote()[
  Over the past year I have watched Janet’s interest in Peace and Conflict Studies blossom into a very powerful thesis topic on issues of gender and politics in Northern Ireland. My area of expertise is in the area of gender and nationalism in Northern Ireland; for this reason I am confident when I say she has chosen a fascinating topic for exploration. As part of her research, Janet conducted a case study of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition (NIWC) last summer. She spent three months in Belfast conducting ethnographic and archival research. The NIWC is a cross-community coalition that was formed in 1996 and fully participated in the peace talks which led to the signing of the Easter Agreement. Recently, the NIWC has found itself at the center of political debates focused on issues of gender, class, and nationalism.
]

Seeking even more contextual efficiency than in the above example, many writers embrace the economy and fluidity fostered by single transition words, especially as they open paragraphs. When a closing paragraph of a recommendation letter begins with a simple transition word such as “Clearly” or “Indeed,” readers sense that the student is viewed in a warm, subjective, and emphatic manner, and they are invited to agree with the detail and spirit of that assessment. A simple transition word also has much more impact than some informal and inefficient phrasing such as “As far as the way I currently see Daniella overall. . . .” Bleah.


Below is a list of transition words that many writers find helpful. As a teacher of writing, I’m always slightly hesitant about providing word lists for fear that writers will simply select from them blindly—a “plug and chug” mentality—or reject the idea of a word list as too elementary. However, my experience with faculty has been that they do appreciate lists and use them appropriately as they consider options for how best to argue a student’s case.

Common Transition Words and Their Functions

Surprisingly

Finally

On the whole

Causality

Consequently
For this reason
Hence
Therefore
Thus

Similarity

In particular

To enumerate

In addition to the transition words listed above, you might find frequent use for simple contextual transitions that announce a paragraph or sentence topic simply by categorizing the criterion that you are about to address—words such as “Academically,” “Analytically,” “Athletically,” “Culturally,” “Intellectually,” “Linguistically,” “Scholastically,” “Socially.” Such words are valuable because they lend economy and establish immediate focus. However, avoid nonstandard usage of the suffix “-wise” to mean “in relation to”; such a practice creates irritating coined words such as “Knowledgewise,” or “Intellectualwise,” resulting in sloppy writing (and, in the two cases just cited, unintentional irony).

transitions are phrases or words used to connect one idea to the next
transitions are used by the author to help the reader progress from one significant idea to the next
transitions also show the relationship within a paragraph (or within a sentence) between the main idea and the support the author gives for those ideas
different transitions do different things....


Additive Transitions:
These show addition, introduction, similarity to other ideas, &c.
Addition:

or,	in fact,	actually,	to say nothing of,	 
too,	let alone,	much less	additionally,

This page only provides a list of transitional words; be certain you understand their meanings before you use them. Often, there exists a slight, but significant, difference between two apparently similar words. Also remember that while transitions describe relationships between ideas, they do not automatically create relationships between ideas for your reader. Use transitions with enough context in a sentence or paragraph to make the relationships clear.

Example of unclear transition:

The characters in Book A face a moral dilemma. In the same way, the characters in Book B face a similar problem.

Improved transition:

The characters in Book A face a moral dilemma, a contested inheritance. Although the inheritance in Book B consists of an old house and not a pile of money, the nature of the problem is quite similar.

Examples of Transitions:

Illustration

Thus, for example, for instance, namely, to illustrate, in other words, in particular, specifically, such as.

Contrast

On the contrary, contrarily, notwithstanding, but, however, nevertheless, in spite of, in contrast, yet, on one hand, on the other hand, rather, or, nor, conversely, at the same time, while this may be true.

Addition

And, in addition to, furthermore, moreover, besides, than, too, also, both-and, another, equally important, first, second, etc., again, further, last, finally, not only-but also, as well as, in the second place, next, likewise, similarly, in fact, as a result, consequently, in the same way, for example, for instance, however, thus, therefore, otherwise.

Time

After, afterward, before, then, once, next, last, at last, at length, first, second, etc., at first, formerly, rarely, usually, another, finally, soon, meanwhile, at the same time, for a minute, hour, day, etc., during the morning, day, week, etc., most important, later, ordinarily, to begin with, afterwards, generally, in order to, subsequently, previously, in the meantime, immediately, eventually, concurrently, simultaneously.

Space

At the left, at the right, in the center, on the side, along the edge, on top, below, beneath, under, around, above, over, straight ahead, at the top, at the bottom, surrounding, opposite, at the rear, at the front, in front of, beside, behind, next to, nearby, in the distance, beyond, in the forefront, in the foreground, within sight, out of sight, across, under, nearer, adjacent, in the background.

== Superlatives


Chapter 1 thoroughly discusses the issue of how to give praise effectively. Both in the literature and anecdotally, letter readers note that the superlatives used in a recommendation letter can be the most revealing characteristic of all. In particular, adjectives that express the level of quality in a student’s work or character—especially when they are presented with ethos and amidst convincing evidence—demonstrate both your belief in the student and your acumen as an evaluator.

Adapting from a study of 625 reference letters (1), what follows is a short list of some of the superlatives used in those letters, categorized here by function:


Intellect

imaginative
insightful
intelligent
discerning
knowledgeable
original
analytical
far-sighted
logical
skilled  
astute
adaptable
resourceful
self-reliant
thoughtful
judicious
perceptive
inquisitive
bright

Work Ethic

precise
persistent
resolute
serious
committed
orderly
prompt
efficient
responsible
persevering
sure
alert
businesslike
thorough
confident
tenacious
hard-working
methodical
determined

Teperment

good-natured
likeable
considerate
affable
patient
tolerant
composed
restrained
earnest
bold
gregarious
polished
adventurous
team-oriented
spirited
sociable
open
frank
assured

Vigor

active
energetic
self-starting
enthusiastic
vigorous
pace-setting
eager
diligent
zealous
fast
productive
enterprising
certain
speedy
self-driving
independent
ambitious
on-the-ball
industrious


What’s especially interesting about this list, which can be used to generate ideas for superlatives when writing letters, is how the adjectives most definitive of work ethic and character (“pace-setting,” “tenacious,” “on-the-ball”) immediately suggest that the evaluator has thoughtfully assessed the student’s talents in context rather than just plugged in a term arbitrarily. One working in a lab where radioactive waste is handled, for example, needs to be “diligent,” “orderly,” and even “fastidious”; one seeking to teach poetry writing needs to be “creative,” “understanding,” and “enthusiastic.”

In this example—a paragraph taken from a sample letter in Chapter 6—we see how superlatives can be used both to leverage the student and to define a field in which the student works:

#quote()[
  As Janet dared in English, she has come to dare in her other choices: in her application to and involvement in the Bucknell NSF-REU in physics; in her summer work with the Biomaterials and Bionanotechnology Summer Institute funded by NSF and NIH. A technical and rapidly expanding field such as neurophysics requires students to think out of the box. If ever a student were capable of extraordinary achievement in such a field, Janet is it—precisely because she thinks out of so many boxes simultaneously. Janet’s abilities extend from sophisticated mathematics to the clear articulation of computational problems and solutions; from high-level physics to the demonstration of concepts; from the smallest detail (or molecule, as she might say) to the biggest picture (or, the cosmos).
]

Of course, one needs to practice restraint when praising a student’s abilities as well. As one group of authors from a recent study on recommendation letters noted: “A member of my department once expressed to me his frustration that the prevalence of superlatives made it impossible to make anyone believe how good a certain student of ours actually was” (2). By sheer volume or the whiff of exaggeration, superlatives applied to a student’s accomplishments, especially without contextual evidence to back them up, might simply cloud judgment. Encomium heaped too generously only invites doubt.

How to Write a Good Recommendation
By Julie Miller Vick and Jennifer S. Furlong January 31, 2008
Question: In my department, we are finding that the largest problem in evaluating candidates for new appointments, promotion, or tenure is in their letters of reference, which often fail to address our criteria. Have you ever considered a column on how to be a good reference?

Answer: While we have written a couple of columns on how to get strong recommendations for your first (or second or third) foray on the academic job market -- “How Important Are Letters of Recommendation?” and “Getting Good References in Bad Circumstances” -- we have never focused a column on how to write those letters.

It’s no secret that many letters of recommendation -- whether they are for someone seeking a job opening, or for a faculty member seeking promotion and tenure -- are so full of superlatives as to be almost meaningless. We decided to ask administrators and faculty members to share their experiences with both kinds of letters. What makes a good letter? How does a letter for a job applicant differ from one for a tenure candidate? And what do both types of letters often fail to mention?

One constant in the suggestions we heard: Letter writers need to give a clear picture of the impact of the subject’s work. Explain the context of a candidate’s research and give readers a sense of how that work can, and will, contribute to a given field.

One of our sources made a great comparison between the challenge of writing a letter of reference and the task facing Clarence, the angel in It’s a Wonderful Life: “Clarence elucidates the importance of George Bailey’s life by showing George what it would have been like if George had never been born. A great letter explains what a field or discipline would have been like if the candidate had never contributed to it, and thereby establishes the candidate’s contribution.”

Job candidates seek out letters from someone who knows their work best. In many, if not most disciplines, those letters extol the applicant’s virtues.

As one associate professor of English noted, “The level of praise is so high that any assessment short of ‘brilliant’ can look tepid. That means that any consideration of a candidate’s weakness is probably a kiss of death.”

An assistant professor of health policy said reference letters are “one of the last things I look over in reviewing an application. As they will almost invariably be positive, I use them mainly to confirm impressions from a candidate who has already piqued my interest.”

Job-market letters suffer from the “Lake Wobegon phenomenon,” said a dean of academic affairs in the biomedical sciences, referring to Garrison Keillor’s mythical town where “all the children are above average.”

Indeed, we sometimes hear from job candidates worried that their letter writers might not be aware of that, and might doom their candidacy from the start by writing a more reasonable assessment. If you are a faculty member inexperienced with composing reference letters, you should check with senior professors in your department to make sure your letters have the right tone.

Given the required rhetoric of excellence, how can a letter for a job candidate be written to be more useful?

We received several excellent suggestions. Make the letter as concrete as possible, including precise descriptions of the applicant’s work, and his or her relationship to the letter writer. “Detailed portraits [of teaching] are the most helpful,” said one associate professor of English.

The dean of academic affairs we talked with said that details help to give “a rationale for the superlatives -- not just that ‘Dr. Smith is the greatest academic of her generation’ but why she is special.” Job candidates can help their letter writers be concrete by providing them with useful materials such as an updated CV, recent research papers, teaching evaluations, and sample syllabi when asking for a recommendation.

The associate professor of health policy echoed the call for specificity: Details can help those reading the letters “get an idea of the quality of the relationship, and how the referee regards the applicant beyond the effusive praise that is often standard.”

ADVERTISEMENT
A good letter of reference will also contextualize the candidate’s research in a meaningful way, making it interesting even to those committee members who know little about the area of expertise. As the associate professor of English put it, “The most helpful letters are those that deftly explain the ‘payoff’ of a candidate’s research project.”

Writing a letter of reference is a professional service, not only to candidates, but also to the search committees evaluating them. You shouldn’t write a positive letter of recommendation if you can’t do so honestly. As the dean of academic affairs said, “Letter writers should be advised that they don’t want to acquire a reputation as ‘easy,’ or even worse as a provider of bad advice. Their credibility is on the line every bit as much as the candidate’s credentials.”

Letters supporting a faculty member’s promotion or tenure differ significantly from those supporting a potential hire. Tenure letters are supposed to be objective so they are more likely to include both praise and criticism. The letter writers tend to be faculty members from outside the subject’s department who have expertise in the relevant subject area but who don’t necessarily know the candidate well. And while a letter for a potential hire might focus more on her scholarly potential, a letter for a tenure candidate will concentrate more on evaluating the work he has already completed.

“In my field,” said the associate professor of English, “even supportive promotion-and-tenure letters are often careful assessments of strengths and weaknesses. (I would say that for a good, tenurable candidate, about 40 percent offer only praise and 60 percent combine praise and criticism.) ... A good letter will help nonspecialists to fit a given scholar into a broader context of currents in the field, highlight especially fine dimensions of the work, and offer a fair-minded discussion of what seems more questionable about the research (as opposed to small-minded complaints or criticisms that stem only from the letter writer’s own intellectual predilections. This happens with some frequency, unfortunately).”

ADVERTISEMENT
The danger of including critical comments is that they give administrators and campuswide tenure committees a rationale for sinking a promotion -- even one that is strongly supported by the department. Still, this associate professor said, “The value of rigorous, contextualized evaluations probably outweighs this danger.”

In writing a lucid evaluation of someone’s work, again, the key is to think about a candidate’s impact on a given field. “For tenure deliberations,” said the dean of academic affairs in the biomedical sciences, “we are most interested in an evaluation of the candidate’s impact on his or her field and/or most important achievements. Many letters re-describe the candidate’s scholarship, typically available from the personal statement, but entirely duck the question of impact/importance.”

When the evaluative component is left out of those letters, they are often read with frustration by tenure-and-promotion committees, as the dean illustrated with the following examples:

What the letter says: “I am thrilled to provide a reference for Dr. So-and-So, whom I trained and with whom I thereafter collaborated for many years.” What the committee members think: The department was supposed to get letters from objective reviewers. Why is it wasting the reference’s time, and ours?

What the letter says: “Dr. So-and-So richly deserves this promotion. She has published 79 papers on Garcia’s disease and received 7 NIH grants.” What the committee members think: Big deal. We can count, too. This letter writer is too lazy or ignorant to read the work and evaluate it.

What the letter says: “Dr. So-and-So is a remarkable scholar.” What the committee members think: Yes, but remarkably good or remarkably bad? It would be nice for you to tell us.

What the letter says: “Dr. So-and-So is of good character and meets the highest standards of professional ethics.” What the committee members think: Nice to know, but what does that have to do with academic achievement?

What the letter says: “If my beloved mother, blessed be her memory, had had Garcia’s disease, I would have wanted her to be in Dr. So-and-So’s care.” What the committee members think: What’s love got to do with it?

The dean also talked about an issue that merits more discussion in academe: the difference in recommendation letters written for men and women. He suggested that people writing reference letters read a 2003 article in Discourse and Society, by Frances Trix and Carolyn Psenka, “Exploring the Color of Glass: Letters of Recommendation for Female and Male Medical Faculty.” They found that letters for male faculty members were longer and included more repetition of strong words like “outstanding,” “excellent,” and “superb,” compared to the letters for their female counterparts. The letters for men also tended to refer more to their research and professionalism, while the letters for women tended to emphasize their teaching and training, effectively portraying them “as students and teachers, whereas the men are portrayed more as researchers and professionals.”

It is important to pay attention to the language you use when describing male and female candidates, and make sure you are providing as unbiased an evaluation of both as possible.

We urge letter writers to balance superlatives with cogent evaluation of a candidate’s actual and potential contributions to the field in question. By carefully crafting a letter of recommendation, you will not only provide the best assistance to the candidate but also enhance your reputation in your discipline and the larger scholarly community.
