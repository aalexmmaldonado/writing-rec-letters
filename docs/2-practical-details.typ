= Practical Details when Writing Recommendation Letters

#quote(attribution: [Confucius])[
  The essence of knowledge is, having it, to apply it, not having it, to confess your ignorance.
]

== Introduction

Perhaps the best way to describe the value of minding practical details is to consider what happens when we do not.
My favorite page of my Family Handyman magazine is the “Great Goofs” back page, where do-it-yourselfers bemoan how they accidentally built a beautiful brick patio overtop their septic holding tank cleanout, or miswired a metal bathroom fixture, which energized the bathroom’s foil wallpaper and shocked anyone who touched the walls.
I have my own “Great Goofs” submission if I ever decide to own up to it: I once installed a tile ceiling in my basement, and as I proudly prepared to staple in one of the last tiles I noticed that the furring strip wasn’t tight up against the ceiling beam, so I forcefully drove in an extra long nail for good measure---smack into the house’s main water supply pipe that ran through the beam, promptly flooding my new ceiling.

After reviewing over 400 letters for this handbook and discussing the subject with faculty, I’ve come across a number of “great goofs” suitable for publication: The professor/scientist who wrote a five-page reference letter for his student, using 70 percent of the letter to describe his own research.
The grad student who addressed her student’s letter of reference envelope and popped it in the mail, then found the letter back in her mail slot three days later—she had mailed it back to herself.
The instructor who had to submit his letter electronically and resorted to a lot of cut and pasting to save time, pasting in his Social Security number where the date should have been.
As these examples show, our ability to mind the details when writing a reference letter becomes critical to our student’s success (and our own pride and professionalism).

So attend to the practical matters discussed in this chapter.
It pays off, and keeps you out of the “great goofs” club, which already has enough members.

Reference Letters
Why write a letter of recommendation?   

Letters of recommendation are often used by an organization's hiring officials to gather additional information about a candidate. It is assumed that a confidential letter of recommendation will provide a candid viewpoint of an applicant's abilities and professional promise. The letter of recommendation should give a picture of the candidate's personal characteristics, performance and experience, strengths, capabilities, and professional promise from someone who has worked closely with the candidate. The selection committee relies on these letters to assist in making a final decision.

When not to write a letter of recommendation.   

There are several reasons to refuse a request to write a letter of recommendation. You may not know the applicant well enough, you may not have time to write it by the time the applicant needs it, you may not feel you could say good things about the applicant, etc. You need to be honest with the applicant about your reasons. If it is lack of knowledge, perhaps a conversation could give you enough information, or the time frame might be negotiable. If you feel you can't write a good letter, it is vital for the applicant to clearly hear why. This can be an opportunity for growth and a "reality check" for the applicant. It is difficult to say no, but if done with grace and tact, it can be quite productive for the applicant in the "long run."

What to write?   

Preferably, the person writing the letter of recommendation has been in a supervisory or mentor relationship with the applicant. The letter should be about one page in length, and generally consist of three parts: the opening, the body, and the closing.

 Opening

     The writer should explain the relationship between himself/herself and the candidate as well as why the letter is being written. Were you a supervisor? President of the company? Advisor? Professor? It is important to indicate this because a professor may see the academic skills while a supervisor may be able to identify work habits.

 Body

     The body of the recommendation should provide specific information about the applicant based upon the observations of the writer. Information may include: 1) personal characteristics such as poise, confidence, dependability, patience, creativity, etc.; 2) Specific areas of strength or special experiences/projects on which they work; and. 3) How they work with other people, etc. The applicant may have some exceptional strengths such as a very high energy level or excellent communication skills. An applicant may also have a specific area of knowledge or experience such as a strong background in science, an undergraduate degree in another area or related work experience in education, a research project, coaching, extracurricular activities, etc.

 Closing

     The closing of the letter should briefly summarize previous points and clearly state that you recommend the candidate for employment (or graduate school, etc.). Finally, you want to give them your contact information in case they want to contact you directly.

The Meeting   

Meeting with the applicant can yield a great deal of information. You should be inquiring (they should be telling you) about what this letter will be used for, in general (ie. employment, graduate school, scholarships, etc.). The applicant should also supply you with information regarding their relevant skills, experiences, abilities, strengths, qualities and qualifications - anything that will help you write the letter. Have the person give you a list of accomplishments, organizations that he/she belongs to, or any other relevant information. It might surprise you to see how much that person has done outside of your contact with them. This can also help you get a more accurate picture of the individual. Having the person give you a copy of his/her resume is an easy way to have this information at hand. You have got to find out what sets the applicant apart from the "average." The more informed you are, the higher quality the letter and the quicker and easier it will be to write it. A simple question "Why should I write you a letter" can be enough to get the conversation started.

Important Points To Keep In Mind   

1. Give honest and factual information. The letter should not include anything you are not willing to defend in public. Employers often skim the letter and pick up the phone and ask you pointed questions about what you wrote and how the applicant specifically could benefit their organization.

2. Concentrate on several different aspects of the applicant. Specifically identify his/her skills, attitudes, personal attributes and growth, as well as his/her contributions to and performance within your organization. It is extremely important to include examples where possible. It is one thing to state that someone had some good ideas and another to say, "John consistantly used his creativity in designing eye-catching promotional materials which translated into higher numbers of residents attending his programs." Also, if you do make negative comments, back them up with facts.

3. The appearance of a letter is a reflection on both you and the candidate and it can also determine whether it will be read or not. Please type your recommendation neatly. You may want to keep a copy on computer for future updates.

4. If you are using a standard recommendation form, please do not restrict your reference to the space provided. Feel free to use office letterhead or stationary. Written comments on the form or on an additional page should not leave any questions in the mind of the reader. .

5. Don't reference characteristics that can be the basis of discrimination, such as race, color, nationality, gender, religion, age, appearance, any handicapping condition, marital or parental status, or political point of view. In cases where an applicants strengths or involvement would clearly state such issues (ie. President of BiGala) you will need to closely work with applicant to determine their comfort level in terms of what you write.

6. The letter should include a reachable phone number for the writer. You should keep a copy and expect a call (some HR officers believe that they can get a more authentic "read" of recommendations by phone. It's not necessarily true, but they do call). Not remembering what you wrote would reflect poorly on your credibility.

Confidential vs. Non-Confidential Letters   

Ask the applicant if this letter will be confidential or non-confidential; it is their choice. If it will be confidential, you will need to send the letter directly to the organization to which they are applying or the Career Services office if they have opened a reference folder. Some employers (traditional organization like banks, or any educational institutions) prefer confidential letters; the rest are about equally divided in regards to which of the two types they prefer.

Character References

These are generally used to support a candidate in terms of his/her personal qualities, not necessarily his/her professional competencies. Generally, these are not very valuable for employers as they don't necessarily speak to the applicants work experience and related strengths as assessed from a supervisor or mentor of some kind.

Words Can Make The Difference!   

Beware of the power of words! Some words seem harmless in every day conversation, but carry positive or negative connotations to a prospective employer.

Avoid bland words such as:

Powerful     nice     good     fairly     reasonable     decent     satisfactory     various

Words which are appropriate to use include:

 articulate      effective     sophisticated     intelligent     observant

 significant     expressive     creative     efficient     cooperative

 imaginative     assertive     dependable     mature     innovative

Additional "power words" can be found in our action words handout.

What Do Employers Look For In Applicants?   

The following is a list of attributes often listed by employers as tools on which to base eventual selection. So, these are excellent points to address:

 ability to communicate     intelligence

 self-confidence     willingness to accept responsibility

 initiative     leadership

 energy level     imagination

 flexibility     interpersonal skills

 self-knowledge     ability to handle conflict

GSAS GUIDE FOR TEACHING FELLOWS ON WRITING LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
by Cynthia Verba

WRITING LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO TEACHING
Writing letters of recommendation is a skill that will be of great importance throughout your teaching career, and perhaps should be viewed as an almost integral part of your teaching experience. Students in your sections or tutorials who have had a positive experience - in terms of what they have learned, or the work they have produced - are likely to come to you for a letter of recommendation. Indeed, an abundance of requests can be taken as an indication that you are a good teacher and have an ability to establish a rapport with your students. In our view, good letter writers deserve considerable recognition for the contribution that they make. (If you have written a large number of letters, you might even consider making a note of that when asked by a potential hiring department about your teaching skills and responsibilities.)

THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
l. In simplest terms, a letter of recommendation is a letter that makes a statement of support for a candidate. If, after doing a careful review of a candidate's strengths and weaknesses, you cannot write a supportive letter, it is important to have a candid discussion with the student.

2. Beyond that simple definition, a letter of recommendation should also present a well-documented evaluation, providing sufficient evidence and information to help a selection committee in making its decision.

3. A letter of recommendation should also address the specific purpose for which it is written - although you will also receive requests from many students for a general letter for their House file, in anticipation of eventual applications. For most applications, a letter of recommendation will need to discuss both scholarly capabilities and personal character - although the balance between the two will vary, depending upon the nature of the application. For example, at one end of the scale, a letter for an applicant for graduate study in the arts and sciences should focus primarily on the scholarly, while at the other end, a letter for an applicant for a non-academic position should discuss a broader range of qualities and experiences - including extracurricular or work experience as well. As a further example of matching a letter with its purpose, a letter for an applicant for a fellowship with a specific project should discuss the validity and feasibility of the project, as well as the candidate's qualifications for fulfilling the project. The letter should pay close attention to the language of the fellowship announcement.

If you have any questions about the criteria for a specific application, consult the appropriate specialists - for example, those who do pre-law, medical, business or fellowship advising at the Office of Career Services or in the Harvard Houses.

4. A letter of recommendation can also be used to explain some weakness or ambiguity in a student's record. If appropriate - and probably after consulting the student - you might wish to mention a family illness, financial hardship, or other factor.

5. For the content of a well-documented letter, the following are further suggestions (see also the samples in the final section):

a. You should promptly identify yourself and the basis of your knowledge of the student: Were you a Teaching Fellow in a tutorial or small seminar for department concentrators? How often did it meet, how many students? how many papers? Do you also know the student through exposure as a House Tutor, or some other capacity? Has your acquaintance been sustained over a number of years? Writing the letter on department letterhead is a further form of identification.

b. In evaluating a student's intellectual capabilities, try to describe the student in terms that reflect that student's distinctive or individual strengths. Whatever strengths strike you as particularly salient, be prepared to back up your judgement with concrete examples - papers, exams, class presentations, or performance in a laboratory.

Above all, avoid the misconception that the more superlatives that you use, the stronger the letter. Heavy use of stock phrases or cliches in general is unhelpful. Your letter can only be effective if it contains substantive information about the student's qualifications.

c. Ranking the student may be requested or desired by selection committees. Having concentrated on the student's individual or unique strengths, you might find it difficult to do so. Ranking is of course less of a problem if a student is unambiguously among the top five or ten percent that you have taught, or so outstanding that he or she would safely rank high in any group. Many of the students who come to you for a letter, however, will not fall within that small unambiguous group. If you wish to offer some comparative perspective, you might be more readily able to do so in more specific areas: Is the student one of the most articulate? original? clear-thinking? motivated? intellectually curious? Some schools or fellowships have forms which ask for rankings broken down into specific areas.

If you lack sufficient information to answer some questions posed or suggested in an application, it is best to maintain the integrity and credibility of your letter, and say only what you are in a position to say.

d. In discussing a student's character, proceed in a similar fashion to the intellectual evaluation, highlighting individual traits and providing concrete illustrations.

e. After discussing each of the above points, your letter should have some brief summation, giving the main thrust of your recommendation for the candidate.

 

HOW TO ACQUIRE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO WRITE AN EFFECTIVE LETTER
Meeting with the Student
Even if you know a student very well, the process of writing an effective letter can be greatly facilitated if you arrange to have an interview with the student, using this as an opportunity to discuss the student's goals - short-term and long - and to acquire more precise information in any area where it is needed.

Obtaining Written Materials
As you arrange a meeting with a student, you should also ask the student to bring the following items:

1) a resume or curriculum vitae,

2) a paper or an exam written for your course,

3) a copy of the application essay or fellowship statement of purpose

4) a transcript

5) any literature that describes the fellowship or program for which the student is applying; specific recommendation forms or questionnaires if they are provided for the letter writer to complete

6) the date on which the recommendation is due, as well as the address - preferably an addressed envelope to which it must be sent

7) a waiver form (obtained by the student from the House Senior Tutor), indicating whether or not the student waives his or her right to see the letter of recommendation. If the student has any questions about this decision, you might point out that there are important benefits in maintaining the confidentiality of letters. Selection committees, for example, tend to view confidential letters as having greater credibility and assign them greater weight; also, some letter writers actually feel less inhibited in their praise of students in confidential letters. While making these points, be sure to make it clear that it is up to the student to decide.

One other factor that greatly facilitates letter writing is if you can write a letter as soon as possible after you have taught a student, while your impressions are still vivid and fresh. You might consider encouraging students to make their requests early, rather than waiting until senior year or beyond. These early letters can be placed in the students' House files, as well as maintained in your own files for future reference.

FURTHER REFINEMENTS: HANDLING THE EASIEST CASE, THE IN-BETWEEN CASE, AND THE MOST DIFFICULT CASE
The written materials listed above and a discussion with the student will greatly benefit the letter writing process - and indeed, the application process - although in each case it will benefit in a different way. The following are possible scenarios:

The easiest case: A request is made by a student you know very well, have seen in different settings - classroom and House - and whose performance and conduct you find to be consistently outstanding. In this case, you can use the discussion and written materials not only to further refine your own presentation of the student, but to help the student refine the application - and especially the application essay. Many students find it difficult to talk about themselves - even the most articulate. By drawing the student out, asking for further elaboration or more specific details, you can help bring into sharper focus such items as past accomplishments, future plans, or why the student is making this particular application.

The in-between case: A request is made by a student who has made some favorable impression, but you lack considerable information to write a well-documented letter. The benefits of the interview and acquiring written materials are most obvious in this instance. In addition to allowing you to do all of the above, they will allow you to fill in gaps in your knowledge and to gain a clearer view of the candidate. It is particularly helpful for students who tend to be somewhat shy or quiet in class. What you may not have learned about the student in the classroom, you may be able to learn through a discussion that specifically addresses matters that you need to know.

The most difficult case: A request is made by a student who has made no impression, or only a negative impression. In this case, it is extremely important to be both candid and helpful at the same time. One of the things a discussion can accomplish is to give the student a thorough hearing before you decide whether or not you can provide support. If you still find that there is little that you can say in support, you might help the student to identify a more appropriate letter writer, and also explore whether the student is making an appropriate application.

Such a discussion offers an important teaching and advising opportunity - one that may be sorely needed. The student who comes to you for a letter that you cannot write may have a similar problem with other instructors. It is important to discuss with the student how he or she might improve prospects for the future. Above all, it is important to avoid allowing the student to believe that all opportunities have been permanently closed. Try to emphasize the student's potential strengths - perhaps asking the student to share with you a favorite paper or other positive experience that may have occurred outside of your class. The message to convey is that there are constructive steps to be taken, and that if the student has gained a clearer understanding of his or her strengths and weaknesses, then this marks an important first step.

QUESTIONS OF FORMAT AND STYLE, CO-SIGNED LETTERS
In some applications, the format is determined by the application itself: the recommender is asked to answer a series of questions. If a form does not allow you to say everything that you would like to say, it is appropriate to attach additional remarks. Indeed, it is common practice to attach a full letter of recommendation to a form, in addition to responding to questions on the form. Furthermore, if a form asks for information that you cannot provide, it is best to say so. The following are further considerations:

l. The length of a letter: If you follow the above guide-lines, your letter probably will be somewhere between one and two pages. Anything longer than three pages is counter-productive, since readers normally have a quantity of letters to read. On the other hand, anything shorter than a page may imply a lack of interest or knowledge about the student.

2. The care with which you write the letter: This will also influence the effectiveness of the letter. Writing in your best polished prose style is another way of registering your support for the student.

3. Clarification of terms peculiar to Harvard: Terms such as "Tutorial" require some explanation. It may mean that you taught the student in a small seminar, or perhaps you provided individual supervision for the student's thesis. Similarly, if your primary contact with the student is through your role as a House Tutor, it is important to explain that role. It may be useful to clarify that the Harvard Houses are more than dormitories and that they perform academic functions as well.

4. Writing the letter on a word-processor: If possible, do so, and be sure to save the file. Once you have been asked by a student to write a letter, that student may return again and again, over a large number of years, for additional letters. A word-processor allows you to adapt and up-date an original letter with considerable ease. It is a way of protecting your initial investment in time and effort.

5. To whom to address the letter: If a student is applying to similar programs in a number of different schools, your letter can be left virtually unchanged for each application. In this case, addressing the letter "To whom it may concern" will facilitate this multiple use. This is also useful if a student is simply asking for a letter for his or her House file, in anticipation of eventual applications. For medical school applications, the letter should be addressed "To the Admissions Committee." In the case of letters for specific fellowships, each letter should address the appropriate fellowship committee, and make any other adjustments in the letter that may be necessary.

It should be noted that in some cases, letters of recommendation are submitted to a campus representative, rather than sent directly to a selection committee. The Fulbright Grant is one example; medical schools also require an intermediary, or a composite letter from a Dean. These variations are steps taken after you have produced your letter, and need not affect the process we describe in this guide for writing letters. One other possibility is that the student requests a letter of recommendation for the House file, in anticipation of future applications. The advantage of this early request is that you are asked to write while you still have the student's performance freshly in mind and can write a more vivid letter. Be sure that the student fully informs you as to the purpose and destination of your letter.

6. The issue of gender: In the past, it was common for letter writers to make distinctions in the way they described women versus men. Descriptions often paid greater attention to the personal lives or personal characteristics of women than men, focusing on items that had little proper place or relevance in a letter of recommendation. While this problem has greatly improved, it is still important to remain sensitive to this issue.

7. Co-signing Letters with Senior Faculty: Students at Harvard at times find that all of their potential letter writers - i.e., the teachers who know them best - are graduate students, rather than professors, since graduate students are mainly the ones who teach small sections and tutorials. In most cases, it is important for applications to include at least one letter from a member of the Faculty. If a student in your section is in this situation, you can propose to have the letter co-signed. This would probably require that you prepare a draft of the letter, share it with the course Professor, share as well written materials provided by the student, and also arrange for a meeting between the student and the Professor. (Some of these steps take place in any case as a normal part of course procedure.)

SAMPLE LETTERS (with modifications and deletions in order to preserve anonymity)
SAMPLE A
"I first knew X in the spring of l986 when she was a member of my Freshman Seminar, '. . . .` In such small groups teacher and students come to know one another in a way that is seldom, if ever, possible in large lecture courses. In either forum something can be learned about a student's academic ability, but only in the former can one get a reliable measure of the student as a person. . . . Having kept in touch with X in the intervening years, I am confident in my knowledge of her.

To begin with, she is an excellent student, with a lively curiosity that makes her dissatisfied with superficial explanations. That curiosity frequently led our seminar down avenues and into areas that, otherwise, would have remained unexplored. . . .

One has only to speak to her to recognize her openness and eagerness. It is easy to mistake this for naivete, an error I made when she first told me she had signed up to be an apprentice teacher in one of Boston's more notorious inner city high schools. . . . Throughout the term, often at great cost to her own peace of mind, and sometimes in explicit conflict with the regular teacher, she continued to insist on a high level of performance from her students. She not only survived the term but won the admiration and respect of students accustomed to being patronized by teachers content to believe that nothing much can be expected.

I would expect X to bring these same qualities of character to . . . . That is, an openness to new places, peoples, cultures and customs; a keen intelligence, with which to analyze and order her experience; irrepressible curiosity; and an unusual ability for dealing with people of all ages and conditions. Those qualities, combined with her toughness of character. . ., will enable her to understand and empathize with others while never losing touch with who she is."

SAMPLE B
"X has been an assistant in my laboratory during the past year, and has proven to be exceptional in several respects. First, X is exceptionally intelligent. He proved to be a very quick study, learning the elements of experimental design and the uses of microcomputers in record time. Furthermore, his questions are always thoughtful and penetrating. X threw himself into his assigned projects wholeheartedly, and shows every sign of having real talent in . . . . I was a little surprised by his high degree of enthusiasm because I knew that X was not primarily interested in . . . . When I mentioned this to him, I discovered that he has well defined career goals that mesh with the projects he was working on . . . .

Second, X is exceptionally diligent and hard working. He worked many extra hours over the summer. I vividly recall coming into the lab late in the evening. . . and finding X at work. X invariably finished projects well in advance of our projected target date. X was always cheerful during this intense period, and was a joy to have in the lab.

Third, X is very good at working with other people. He is exceptionally nice and considerate and sensitive. X is not only good humored and friendly, but also is good at gauging other people's level of knowledge and attitudes. . . .

All in all, I think X has a very bright future, and I am sure that he would benefit from . . . . Given his great intelligence and sensitivity, I am sure that he could put . . . to good use.

In short, I give X my highest recommendation, and very much hope that the committee judges his application favorably."

SAMPLE C
"I am writing in support of X to . . . . I have known X since September, l986. He was a member of a small . . . tutorial that I taught in l986-87. . . . X was an active and conscientious member of the class. He challenged the rest of the class to consider issues from new perspectives and often asked very penetrating and important questions. He chose to take on difficult topics and handled them well. His assignments were well-written, well-supported, organized, neat, and timely. It was evident that X really desired to learn more and challenge himself. . . .

X also has interest outside of academics. He has been an active member of . . . , a Harvard singing group, and a member of the campus . . . club. He is also a member of the . . . House film society. X's personality is wonderful. He is outgoing and friendly, but not dominating. He has an obvious and sincere concern for others. . . .

X would be a wonderful student to have at . . . . He has skills that he is eager to share, but he is just as eager to learn. . . . I feel very confident that he will be extremely successful in all his future endeavors. He is a focussed and determined young man. I highly recommend him for . . . ."

SAMPLE D
"I am pleased to write to you on behalf of X, who is applying for a fellowship to study . . . . I have known X for two years. She took my course in . . . . More recently, I have been advising her on her thesis.

X has done well in Harvard's . . . concentration. The concentration includes preparation in . . . . In addition, she has had substantial exposure to the "practical" aspects of her topic, for example through her work at . . . . Thus she is extremely well prepared to fulfill her proposed project.

X has selected an area, . . . , which is of growing interest. . . . In my view as someone who studies . . . among other topics, questions such as this are severely under-researched. The proposed topic - . . . - seems to be both worthwhile and feasible, and should prove very interesting.

X is an independent self-starter. While she has no trouble working in groups, or interacting with others, she can also work well on her own. Furthermore, she is mature and personable. I would expect her to perform well in a wide range of environments. In fact, her personality and skills should place her high on any list of good "representatives" for the U.S.

I hope that you will consider her application strongly."

SAMPLE E
"This letter is in support of X, who is applying for a . . . grant. I have read his statement of purpose with great care; in fact, I have had many discussions with him about his project, which I find both compelling and important.

X is a rare combination: he is already at this young age a seasoned expert in both literature and iconography . . . . Having taught him in a language-intensive course last year, I can bear witness to his superb command of German . . . .

His project's focus of interest, the . . . , is admirably suited to someone of X's talents and industry. The . . . Institute is the ideal place to carry out such research, and I am confident that X`s discoveries will in the long run make an impact on learning in that field.

Add to all this that X is a very congenial person, well-liked by teachers and fellow-students alike, and you will see why I am so positive about this bright and energetic young scholar. I endorse his candidacy with confidence and enthusiasm."

== Letter Length and Form

Although most faculty can readily make their letters look good at a glance thanks to computer software and templates, many still puzzle through the fundamentals of appropriate length and overall form.
The standards are well-established, as discussed below.

=== Length of the Letter

In one study that assessed over 500 letters of recommendation, results indicated that “the strength of the cooperative relationship between recommenders and applicants influenced the favorability and length of the letters” (1).
Another study noted that “the more detail in the letter, the more persuasive” (2).
In other words, a longer letter in the right circumstances gives favor to the candidate, as long as detail in the letter is relevant.

To determine the appropriate length for a letter, balance your knowledge of the student with the weight and opportunity of what the student is applying for.
For instance, if the student is seeking a military position that you have little knowledge of and your evaluation form included a detailed checklist, your letter might be just one or two paragraphs long, efficiently endorsing the student within the context of the whole application.
In most circumstances, however, your letter should fill a page neatly and perhaps go on to a second page.
When students apply for graduate school or a national scholarship, two-page letters are the norm, and very short letters leave candidates at a clear disadvantage.
As faculty who sit on review boards will confirm, letters of three pages or more are simply too lengthy (and often too full of irrelevant detail) for a selection committee to consider efficiently; pare them back.

=== Letterhead and Date

The letterhead should not be included on any pages except the first one, but be sure to number and perhaps date any subsequent pages in case they become separated.
Many writers also provide an appropriate subject line at the top of any pages after the first one (e.g., “Letter of Reference for Janet Lerner—Page 2”).

Thanks to computer software, professional looking letterheads are easily generated, and many faculty use paper with a pre-printed letterheads for their first page.
The best letterhead is that of the department, college, or other organization with which you are most closely affiliated.
If you use some other letterhead, such as that of an inter-office memo or personal stationery, you have not clearly announced your connection to the student and you’ve weakened the letter’s suitability.
If you attach a separate letter to a form, a letterhead is still appropriate.
Date the letter two or so spaces beneath the letterhead at the left or right margin.

=== Address and Greeting

Some writers include the target employer’s or review committee’s address at the top left margin beneath the letterhead and date; others simply begin with a greeting directed to the name of the individual heading the group that will review your letter.
Get the student to give you an actual name if possible.
Archaic greetings such as “Dear Sir or Madam” should be avoided, but some writers still favor the generic “To Whom it May Concern.” If you do not have a person’s name to address the letter to, let the greeting reflect the circumstances to which the letter is tailored—e.g., “Dear Graduate School Selection Committee.”

=== Text Formatting and Paragraph Length

Font sizes of between 10 and 12 and standard publishing fonts such as Times New Roman and Century are preferred.
The convention is to single-space your type, skip lines between each paragraph, and either consistently choose no indentation for paragraphs or indent each paragraph one-half inch.
Preferably, keep your paragraphs reasonably short to enhance readability.
For most circumstances, three to five paragraphs per page seems to be standard, but bulkier paragraphs are possible if introduced with sound topic sentences and with effective transitions imbedded.

=== Closing the Letter

Sign off with “Sincerely” or something similar, then put your handwritten signature beneath, then include your typed name and title on separate lines directly beneath.
Your title connects you to the student directly and affirms your credibility and affiliation.
Identify your full title (“Assistant Professor of Anthropology” rather than just “Assistant Professor”) and include more than one title where logical—if you chaired or advised an organization that the student was involved in, for example, you could include that title as well.
Many writers include the initials of their degrees as well, and some writers include their phone number and e-mail address under their title to facilitate easy follow-up contact.

/*
At some point in your career, it's likely that you'll request a letter of reference or recommendation from someone of importance, or it's possible that you may be asked to write a letter of reference or recommendation for someone else. There's an example of a recommendation letter, including all its parts, later in this article.

It can be a difficult letter to write and it's important that the person writing the letter (whether you or someone writing on your behalf) is qualified to make such a recommendation. It should be someone who has firsthand knowledge of the applicant's professional history and accomplishments, such as a close colleague, employer, immediate supervisor, advisor, professor, client, etc.

The person making the recommendation also needs to be familiar with the applicant's skills, capabilities, experience, contributions and performance, with specific examples to which he or she can refer, where possible.

If you've been requested to write a letter of recommendation for another, and you feel both comfortable and qualified to do so, request that the candidate provide you with a copy of his or her resume, and a list of important qualifications (relevant to the positions being targeted). Have him or her provide you with specific achievements, and a list of any (relevant) professional associations for which he or she is a member. Even a close colleague may be surprised to learn all that a candidate has accomplished or contributed to an organization.

If you're requesting a letter of reference or recommendation be written on your behalf, be sure to supply your reference with this same necessary material.

One of the most important things to remember when creating a letter of recommendation is that it may be kept on file for future reference. Therefore, the letter needs to be factual (honest) and should omit any negative comments or weaknesses.

The reference letter or letter of recommendation should contain the following components:

The applicant's full name (early in the document).

The length of time the reference has known the applicant and in what capacity - An explanation regarding the reference's qualifications to make such a recommendation.

How the applicant is exceptional to others with similar backgrounds or in similar positions. Provide specific examples.

The applicant's professional qualifications (years of experience, academic credentials, etc.) and competency in his or her profession, with examples of specific accomplishments and achievements.

The applicant's character traits relevant to the positions being targeted (avoid mention of any characteristics that could be the basis of discrimination, such as race, religion, color, nationality, age, appearance, marital status, disabilities, etc.). See EEO article for reference.

Traits worth noting include (these are in addition to specific skill sets): ability to communicate (written and verbal), intelligence, self-reliance, initiative, flexibility, willingness to accept responsibility, energy level, direction, interpersonal skills, ability to effectively handle conflict, teamwork, level of commitment, ability to lead, etc.

Avoid "soft phrases" such as "good, adequate, fair, reasonable, satisfactory," etc. Instead, choose more powerful word choices, such as: "exceptional, significant, astute, articulate, versatile, creative, assertive, imaginative, qualified, dedicated, professional, dynamic, and innovative," but be honest.

Contact information for the reference, if he or she is willing to continue future dialogue and/or correspondence regarding the applicant. (Include this reference on your list of references! As the letter of recommendation ages, make certain to maintain current contact information and update your reference list as necessary.)

== Application Services for Medical Programs and Law Programs

For students applying to medical schools and law schools, different rules often apply to the application process, and these rules directly affect recommendation letters as well.

Increasingly, schools serving the medical and law professions are using application services to manage the flow of applications in a streamlined manner.
This allows students to submit applications through a single service to a number of schools at once, and such services provide checklists and benchmarks to applicants to help ensure a successful application.
As one example, pharmcas.org, with the support of The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), is a centralized application service for applicants applying to colleges and schools of pharmacy.
Students applying to dental programs use the Associated American Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS).

Most medical schools subscribe to the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), and students are required to use this service to submit their application materials if their target schools are participants.
With some students applying to 10 or more medical schools, many of their recommendation letters will end up having something of a generic component (though certainly the letter should address the student’s aptitude for the medical profession nonetheless).
Students can include up to 10 letters of recommendation in their application, with the reasoning that this allows recommenders to target particular schools on the student’s behalf—i.e., you might actually need to provide a student with more than one letter for the same application package, with one letter aimed broadly at medical schools and another targeted to a specific program.
Letter writers also have a variety of options about delivering the letter, some of which will be influenced by the writer’s academic institution and its level of relationship with medical schools.
For further information, see the first link in the “Further Study” box below.

As with medical schools, law schools also use a centralized application processing service, allowing for both generalized letters of recommendation (up to four) and additional letters targeted to particular schools.
Hundreds of law schools use the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) Credential Assembly Service, and the LSAC also administers the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) required for law school applicants.
Finally, students using the LSAC Credential Assembly Service typically have to fill out special forms that the recommender must sign as part of the process.

== Handling Electronic Recommendation Letters

As noted in a June 2004 issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education, increasingly graduate schools are creating ways for faculty to deliver recommendation letters online, and in some cases requiring it (3).
Those singing the praises of this practice cite Yale’s graduate school receiving about one-third of its recommendations online during the first year it offered the option, and the fact that more than 100 grad schools were already using online forms as of 2004 (3).

The potential downsides to having to deliver recommendation letters online are many.
Some faculty already resent having to use technology as much as we do, especially to deliver something as important as a letter of reference, and some find it even more time-consuming than the paper recommendation process.
Some faculty also run into technology-related problems—for example, the requirement that the letter is formatted in a particular software, or that the text must be cut and pasted into a box and scrolled through.
Different delivery systems and different websites, of course, have different levels of success, and some websites crash during the process or generate vague messages as to whether the letter has actually been sent.
Weary faculty use the paper option if available, or they learn to adjust to the online system, sometimes seeking voice or e-mail confirmation that their letter has actually been delivered.

Nevertheless, given that online recommendations save processing time, paper, and money, the practice is certain to grow.
In fact, the use of a “Standardized Letter of Recommendation,” where the writer essentially answers multiple choice questions, is also growing in popularity and practice.
Many find such forms both incomplete and unsatisfying as evaluative tools, and some worry about whether they’re shortchanging the student if they don’t choose the highest ranking in all areas.
On the extreme end, websites like www.letters-of-recommendation.org are also popping up, where you fill in cells with your contact information and student’s name, then pick a number of multiple choice answers in a variety of categories, and the letter “writes itself” (yuck).

At times you will be asked to deliver a letter by e-mail or fax.
In such cases—especially if you’re concerned with potential software translation issues—it is wise to seek confirmation that the letter arrived successfully and is formatted as you intended.
If the letter is sent as an e-mail attachment, prepare the attachment as a pdf file if possible to ensure a format identical to the original, and proof it in pdf form as well to be sure that both characters and format were translated properly.

Especially if you’re working with a student applying for a national scholarship, where online submission of materials is becoming the norm, you may also have to register at a website or have the student register you in order to ensure letter delivery.
Such complications underscore how important it can be for faculty to partner both with students and, when relevant, scholarship representatives at your school.
Such partnership is often the only way to be certain that all the mechanics of electronic delivery are addressed.


== Minding the Application Details

Frequently, especially when students apply for grad school or scholarships, the applications are complex enough that your must understand your role as a reference in a broader context.
Otherwise, your letter won’t be as effective, in that it may become redundant or not fit in neatly with other application materials.
Even if students simply ask you for a letter of reference and don’t mention the broader circumstances, it is useful to discuss the application process with them or even look over the application materials yourself, if only to confirm details and full context.

=== Finding Out Who Else is Writing Recommendation Letters

Knowing who else is writing letters for students and how many other recommenders there are—perhaps even suggesting specific individuals—can give you a sense of the necessary depth and scope of your comments.
Students are not always aware that they should choose letter writers who, when considered collectively, provide a balanced, comprehensive picture—they sometimes just automatically try any professor from whom they received a high grade.

Once you know who the other letter writers are, consider how your letter can provide a slant that the others will not.
In some cases, faculty even privately confer with other recommenders to discuss the kinds of details they plan to use—thus they can be sure to provide a balanced picture in relation to the other letters.
There are times where your letter might provide very limited comments based on your limited relationship with the student, and there are times when you will want to be expansive in one area of the student’s background (say, the student’s performance in a research lab) while unconcerned in another area (say, the student’s character).
In such cases, knowing who else is writing letters can also help you point letter readers towards the comments of others for fuller context.

=== Making Certain Access Rights Have Been Waived

Chapter 1 of this handbook discusses the issues of letter confidentiality and access rights in detail.
It is always prudent to be certain that students have checked all boxes in their application confirming they have waived their access rights.
I know of cases where students did not check anything in that category when showing the referees the application, assuring them they would “take care of that later.” I’ve even known of a few cases where the student seemed genuinely puzzled as to what the statement meant because of the wording (I’m afraid that some students misunderstand the meaning of “waive”).
This issue is always worth clarifying with the student to avoid misunderstanding or any uncertainty on your part about the confidentiality of your comments.
Of course, some letter writers aren’t much concerned with the issue, but selection committees do favor letters with confidential comments, assuming that they are more candid.

=== Filling Out Checklists

Frequently you will be asked to fill out checklists to assess the student, either instead of or in addition to sending a letter.
The main issue when filling out checklists should be consistency and continuity in the context of your letter.
If you simply check the highest assessment for every attribute (a potentially suspect practice anyway), and the corresponding letter doesn’t back up this assessment, your credibility as an evaluator suffers and the student is harmed.
When filling out checklists, consider each attribute individually, and never hesitate to resort to the “no opportunity to observe” category if appropriate.
If attaching a separate letter with the checklist, type or handwrite that information in the correct slot of the form, and look over the application for any instructions about how your letter should be attached.
If handwriting, use black ink so that a Xeroxed copy is readable.

=== Delivering the Letter

Although it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to be certain the letter is delivered to the correct party according to application protocol, savvy faculty members check on such details carefully.
Often, application materials instruct you to deliver the letter in a sealed envelope directly to a committee, signed across the seal, or you may be asked to give the letter to the student to be sent with a package of materials.
Students are often invited right in the application to prepare the envelope for you or to use an envelope that comes with the application.
In all cases, a standard practice is for you to deliver the letter in a sealed envelope, signed over the seal to ensure confidentiality.
If the letter is sent through the student as part of a package and a mailing address is not needed, the envelope itself should contain a descriptive phrase, such as “Reference Letter for Janet Lerner,” followed by your name.

=== Attending to the Deadline

Always ask students for a firm completion deadline for your letter, and recognize that it might have to be done earlier than the full application is due if the student is sending in the application package by hand.
Some faculty invite the student to prompt them with a reminder a few days before the letter is due.
Just as we expect students to meet deadlines for us, we should give them the same courtesy.

/*
In addition to standard letter-writing dos and don'ts, there are a number of basic guidelines that apply to most situations related to the writing of letters of recommendation specifically. These are usually more "situational" than "how to" in nature.

These recommendation letter guidelines are important to both note and apply, since writing letters of recommendation is always a somewhat tricky and delicate matter. That's because they almost always affect the reputation and future of another person.

The following is an adapted excerpt from my best selling ebook/book Instant Recommendation Letter Kit.
THE STRATEGIES
The following strategies apply primarily to the writing of letters of recommendation in their various forms (i.e. recommendation letters, reference letters, commendation letters, performance evaluation letters).
1. Write It Only If You Want To
If you are asked by someone to write a recommendation or reference letter about them, you don't have to say "yes" automatically. If it's someone you respect for their work, and you have mostly positive things to say, by all means write the letter.

There is no point saying "yes" and then writing a letter that says nothing good about the person, or worse still, concocting a misleading positive assessment of someone.

So, whatever you do, don't get sucked into writing a recommendation inappropriately out of feelings of guilt or obligation.
2. If You Must Refuse, Do It Right Up Front
On the other hand, if someone asks you to write a recommendation letter for them, and you know you'll be hard-pressed to keep it positive, say "no" right away.

There is no point in hesitating and leading the person on to believe that the answer might eventually be "yes".

A gentle but firm "no" will usually get the message across to the person. Explain that you don't think that you are the best (or most qualified) person to do it.
3. Suggest Someone Else
If you feel you should refuse, for whatever reason, it may be helpful for you to suggest someone else who you think might have a more positive and/or accurate assessment of the person.

That other person may be in a better position to do the assessment. Usually there are a number of possible candidates, and you may not actually be the best one.

In fact, I have seen a number of cases over the years in which people requesting recommendation letters have not requested the letter from the obvious or logical choice. This usually happens when the requestor doesn't like the person who is the obvious choice, and/or they are worried about what that person will say about them.
4. Write It As You See It
Writing a less than honest recommendation letter does no one a favor in the end. It is likely to backfire on you, the person being recommended, and the new employer.

Also, many employers and head-hunting agencies check references these days.

How would you like to be called up and have to mislead people due to questionable things you may have written in a reference letter?
5. Be Honest, Fair, and Balanced
Honesty is always the best policy when it comes to writing recommendation letters. At the same time, try to be fair and balanced in your approach.

If in your estimation, a person has five strengths and one glaring weakness, but that weakness really bothers you, make sure you don't over-emphasize the weak point in the letter based on your personal bias. Just mention it in passing as a weakness and then move on.
6. Balanced Is Best
An overall balanced approach is the best one for a letter of recommendation. Even if your letter generally raves about how excellent the person is, some balance on the other side of the ledger will make it more credible. After all, nobody's perfect.

There must be some area where the person being recommended needs to improve. A bit of constructive criticism never hurts and it will make your letter more objective in nature.
BOTTOM LINE
The most important point to take from the above is that it is your choice as to whether, and how, you will write a recommendation or reference letter.

It's an important type of letter that will have a definite impact on the future of the person about which it is being written, so don't agree to write one unless you are willing to give it your utmost attention and effort.
