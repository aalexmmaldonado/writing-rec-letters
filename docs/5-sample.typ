== Introduction

As a teacher, I know well the problems inherent in providing anything resembling a template.
When I first began teaching resume writing, I wanted my students to have authentic resumes as models, so I gave them copies of resumes by former students with the names whited out.
Inevitably, a few students turned in a resume sans any name at the top, thinking they were dutifully following the model.
Next I took to using example resumes from a text, but the textbook included boxes around the resumes to resemble page edges, so some students handed in their resumes with boxes around them.
Finally, I turned back to real student resumes with fictitious names, but one student actually handed in his resume using the fictitious name, explaining later that he liked the name better than his own.
As a teacher, no matter my approach, it seemed I always managed to find a few students who were determined to surprise.

Though I trust that faculty need no such warnings against viewing exemplars as plug-in templates, I am compelled to explain why I provide sample letters here, and to note how I think samples can best be used.
I’ve heard the comment from colleagues many times: “I write recommendation letters all the time, but I’m really not sure how good they are.” Just as frequently I hear faculty or graduate students say that they’ve been asked to write a letter for the first time, and they’d like to see some good models.

When studied thoughtfully, the 10 sample letters in this chapter reveal far more than how letters can be formatted pleasantly—they represent a range of stylistic choices, show how writers handle specific circumstances, prove that a strong letter from a grad student can be just as helpful as a letter from a tenured faculty member, demonstrate an effective use of jargon, include the kinds of quantitative and qualitative examples that selection committees crave, and provide interesting narratives that bring individual students to life.

I urge you to use these sample letters, and others provided through the links below, to study the art of letter writing, and strive to outdo the samples.

== Sample Short Recommendation Letters


The five sample letters that follow are for circumstances where the candidate is seeking an internship or job, and therefore academics are not the focus.

In the first letter, written by a campus Red Cross Director, the author speaks to qualities about the student such as his ability to work with others, his creativity, leadership, and sensitivity.
Since the student is being recommended for a career in public service, these examples—provided by someone who has witnessed the student’s work outside of the classroom—are highly appropriate.

#quote()[
  *Letter 1*

  Through my campus work with the American Red Cross, I have known John Lerner for approximately six months.
  He introduced himself to me as the co-founder of a new business, Sword of the Round Table (SRT).
  He spent a great deal of time with me when we first met, explaining the ways in which this group could be of service to the American Red Cross.
  Our first project together involved SRT’s promotion of Red Cross Services in exchange for our promotion of a textbook delivery service, after which we expanded into numerous other areas.
  Though I was initially skeptical of the ways in which we could work together, John successfully helped me overcome my concerns, and worked hard to establish a relationship of trust and commitment.

 Sword of the Round Table works to facilitate mutually beneficial relationships between businesses and not-for-profits.
  With the help of SRT, the American Red Cross has increased its exposure in the community, yielding greater participation in our programs.
  With John’s help, the American Red Cross has been able to promote its services through the Mythic University Student Book Store, a highly visible business with a large student clientele.

 John was instrumental in the following initiatives developed with the cooperation of the manager of the Student Book Store:

  + permanent window space to advertise Red Cross programs,
  + periodic Red Cross information tables outside the store,
  + blood schedules to be dispensed with customer purchases,
  + the establishment of the first “Business Partnership Award,” designed to encourage
   other business/not-for-profit partnerships in our community.

  Another example of John’s creativity was the development of a poster-sized “Semester-at-a-Glance” calendar for Mythic University students to purchase.
  This calendar will promote Red Cross services, listing campus bloodmobiles, along with other important student-based events.
  Part of the proceeds from this calendar will directly benefit the American Red Cross.

 John is a valuable student leader, delegating with authority and competence.
  In addition to his assistance as a co-founder of SRT, he has been of tremendous value to my program as a resident assistant.
  He voluntarily made presentations on the importance of donating blood to other resident assistants, as well as to the residence hall council of which he is a member.
  John’s role as a persuasive and informative disseminator of information is a valuable one.
  It will certainly translate into the enrollment of new blood donors into our system.
  He has also shared information about donating blood to dozens of fraternities and sororities at Mythic University.

  John is a tireless volunteer and leader, and has demonstrated great sensitivity to organizational needs, as well as creativity in solving problems.
  He is perceptive, emphatic, and committed to every task he takes on.
  In my six years of work with the American Red Cross, I have never encountered a more capable or hard-working student volunteer.
  John will be a committed and creative public servant, and I recommend him highly indeed.

The next three letters, written for students seeking internships or summer program positions, are all sensibly just one page, using examples from classrooms and labs to demonstrate potential.
One letter notes the fact that the student has a 4.0 GPA, while another represents how the student handled herself in the presence of the president of the university.
Another letter even represents honestly how the student has grown over time, citing the student’s struggle “to see her own potential earlier in her college career.”
For those reading such letters and deciding on whether or not to hire and help advance a student’s training, such details are all equally interesting—academic success, maturity, and evidenced growth are all traits that employers embrace in those they hire.

  *Letter 2*
  
  I am writing in enthusiastic support of Janet Lerner for an internship.
  I have known Janet since she was a student in my course in Synoptic and Dynamic Meteorology last fall.
  Janet distinguished herself in my course by receiving the highest grade in the class.
  But this accomplishment only scratches the surface of her ability and character.
  Janet is the type of person who loves learning.
  She’s one of those rare people who works very hard and diligently, but does so with a smile on her face.
  She constantly strives for excellence in meteorology, but Janet does not let her thirst for knowledge rule her life.
  She is a scientific humanist, with a genuine caring for others.
  It should come as no surprise that Janet is well-liked and admired by her peers.

  Janet’s knowledge of the intricacies of how the atmosphere works was unrivaled in my course, allowing her to easily win a competitive class forecasting contest. Janet is also a leader, holding a position in the Campus Weather Service, a student-run organization that provides weather information to radio stations across five states.

  I know first-hand that Janet performs with aplomb in challenging situations. I was in the Weather Station one day while Janet was conducting a tour for parents and their young daughters. The president of Mythic University happened to be in the group—an intimidating presence to most undergraduates—but Janet handled herself with a polished confidence, attending to audience questions about meteorology in a clear, friendly, unaffected manner.

  In short, Janet’s high caliber of character and keen meteorological expertise set her well above others at her level of education. I warmly recommend her for an internship.

  *Letter 3*

  I am writing in support of Mr.
  John Lerner’s application to participate in the NNUN Research Experiences for Undergraduates program this summer.

  Mr.~Lerner is a student in Materials Science and Engineering at Mythic University.
  He is pursuing a joint BS/MS degree in our Integrated Undergraduate/Graduate program in Materials Science and Engineering.
  He possesses a perfect 4.0 GPA, and has shown significant aptitude in performing research in my group.
  He is planning to use this research for his dissertation.

  Among his accomplishments, last year Mr.
  Lerner was the sole recipient of our department’s research fellowships for first-year students, and has selected a project in my group concerning the role of tin doping on the structure, surface chemistry, and nano-indentation behavior of soda lime silica glass.
  He began working alongside my graduate students in the fall term, and has been actively engaged in glass batching, melting, fining, and surface preparation for subsequent analyses.
  He is continuing this research this semester, focusing on examining the leaching and hydration behavior of the doped glasses.
  This work will lead to an examination of the role of tin on hydrated layer formation and alteration of the surface elastic properties as measured by nano-indentation techniques.

  In addition to his academic and research performance, Mr.~Lerner also interacts well with his colleagues.
  He is an articulate, polite, informed, and motivated young man.
  He participates well in my bi-weekly research group meetings, is always well prepared for our one-on-one meetings on his research progress, and has an excellent vision of where he would like to go, academically, over the next few years.
  I think he would be an excellent REU candidate, and I enthusiastically endorse his application.

  *Letter 4*

  I am writing on behalf of Ms.~Janet Lerner, an undergraduate with whom I have been acquainted for four years as her graduate student lab supervisor.
  A biochemistry major, Janet has dedicated much of her time outside of the classroom to research directed by our mentor Dr.~John Teacher.
  Janet’s efforts have been fruitful: she has contributed data to at least one manuscript and has delivered several successful poster presentations.

  Over the years, I have had the pleasure of watching this young woman blossom into a focused, selfassured scholar who aspires to a career combining both clinical and basic research.
  Although Janet struggled to see her own potential earlier in her college career, encouragement from her advisor as well as her labmates, coupled with her own growing desire to succeed, transformed this once tentative student into an important contributor to the lab.
  Even as a senior graduate student, I have benefited from Janet’s presence in the lab.
  She has excellent lab hands, and she is, in fact, responsible for teaching me some of the main staples of molecular biology, which have become essential to my work.
  Furthermore, Janet’s mastery of quantitative RT-PCR, in particular, has made her an invaluable resource for undergraduate and graduate students alike.
  An undergraduate who has earned my implicit trust and respect, Janet would surely be an asset to any laboratory.

  Janet’s talents and motivations are not limited strictly to the lab, however.
  She is a young person who cares deeply about the social implications of science and who has demonstrated this conviction through several substantial internships.
  Working closing with a well-known local TV health correspondent, one of Janet’s internships involved producing news stories that pertained to health-related topics.
  Another internship focused on health education locally.
  Her efforts culminated in an HIV/AIDS prevention program designed for teenagers at risk for infection in the local area.
  These few examples embody the depth of Janet’s commitment to science, which for her begins at the bench top, but has important implications at the bedside.

  Without hesitation, I recommend Ms.~Janet Lerner unequivocally for the Research in Science and Engineering summer program.

The final letter in this set recommends a student for a job giving tours of animatronic displays.  Accordingly, the writer focuses on the student’s depth of knowledge in a relevant subject area and her communication skills. The writer also dares to be even more personal, noting that the student has “firm spiritual roots and an active, diverse, social life; she is loyal, committed, and clear-sighted.” Such personal detail tells us that the recommender knows the student well and admires her, and thus we trust the letter author and her endorsement.

#quote()[
  *Letter 5*

  In my opinion, I have never before written a recommendation letter where the candidate and the opportunity were such a perfect fit.
  I have known Janet Lerner for two years now, since she took my introductory course in dinosaurs during her sophomore year.
  In my long teaching career, I have never met an undergraduate student with such a genuine and focused interest in paleontology, and such a clear aptitude for it.
  I will demonstrate this by speaking to Janet’s ability as a communicator, her specific interest in dinosaur paleontology, and her maturity and integrity.

  Janet informs me that you are seeking a skilled communicator to give tours of your animatronic displays.
  Even during her sophomore year, Janet was a skilled communicator on the subject of dinosaur paleontology.
  In my class, for which she received an A, Janet wrote two compositions: one on the roots of the discovery and the characteristics of Deinonychus; one evaluating the defensive capabilities of Euoplocephalus.
  Janet proved herself not only exceptionally articulate and schooled on the subject at hand, but she also showed herself capable of wielding an argument—moving from premise to conclusion based on relevant evidence.
  Janet also did all this with style and flair.
  I cite excerpts from her papers: “Previously seen as cold-blooded, pea-brained lizards ...” and “The toe muscles acted as a spring mechanism to flick the claw around towards the back of the foot.”
  For me, such articulations underscore both Janet’s authentic fascination with dinosaurs and her ability to communicate that excitement and knowledge to others.

  As an academic advisor to the dormitory where Janet lives, I frequently witness her interactions with others and know first-hand of her community service.
  Last year, Janet was the elected vice-president in the dormitory, and in this role she was responsible for numerous functions, including faculty/student lunches and a recruiting phoneathon.
  Janet is well-respected in the dormitory—a popular figure known for her honesty, calm, and kindness.
  I have seen her handle delicate situations with discretion, and she handles herself in all situations with poise.

  Finally, Janet has strong convictions tempered by good judgment and reason; she has firm spiritual roots and an active, diverse, social life; she is loyal, committed, and clear-sighted.
  It is a rare treat to encounter a student as impressive as Janet Lerner, and if you give her the opportunity I am sure you will find her equally impressive.
  Please do give her your most thoughtful consideration.

== Sample Teaching Recommendation Letters

Two recommendation letters for students going into the teaching profession, which you can download by clicking on the link below, demonstrate the traits that employers seek in teachers. When students have done student teaching in schools, at least one of their recommendation letters is written by the faculty supervisor of their student teaching program.

In the first letter, kept efficient at one page, the writer makes it clear that she knows the student not as a teacher but as a performer in her class who has kept in touch with her outside of the classroom. She uplifts the student by tracing their two-year history, and noting that the student attended a fiction reading that she gave. Most importantly, she shows that she can comfortably view the student as a teacher, citing his resume: “And I see this same ideal—one that he wants to pass on to his future students—even in the careful wording of his career objective on his resume, where he speaks of helping students achieve their ‘academic, athletic, and social potential.’” This letter demonstrates that even a writer with limited knowledge of the student’s work can write an effective letter by partnering with the student on the process.

The second letter, more extensive at two pages, comes from the student teaching supervisor, who also taught a concurrent course and web-based portfolio workshop in which the student was enrolled. Therefore, the examples provided come directly from these relevant experiences, and they go into a good deal of depth—citing lesson design, scientific principles taught, direct interactions with students, and use of technology. The letter is also filled with affirmations about the student as a future teacher: “He is thoughtful, reflective, and committed to life-long learning and continued development as an educator.” One of the final sentences both recommends the student and reminds readers of the relationship that the letter writer had with the student: “After evaluating his work, observing his performance in class, and supervising his teaching, I feel confident that Mr. Lerner will make a significant contribution as an elementary educator.”

  *Letter 6*

  This letter offers my complete support of John Lerner as he applies for a teaching position.
  I’ve known John for two years now, since he completed my course in Advanced Fiction Writing at Mythic University.
  In this course, John wrote three pieces of short fiction for me, and I recall that in one of them in particular his revisions after a group discussion of his work were substantial and well-focused.
  I also recall that John was one of those few I could turn to when I needed to spark discussion; he was never lethargic, uninterested, or unprepared, but always willingly thoughtful and articulate.
  He provided me with a touchstone for what was best in the class.

  Since John took the class he has kept in touch with me, in particular by seeking my advice on a literary paper he was writing last year and by attending a fiction reading that I gave recently.
  Based on these interactions, over the last two years I have come to see John as a bright, personable, energetic, and mature person with a concrete, ongoing, well-rooted interest in teaching.
  As I glance over his credentials that he gave me when he asked me to write him a letter of reference, I am struck by just how much he has already done in various positions—whether volunteer or paid—and what this reflects about his work ethic.
  His work in Outward Bound programs, athletics, and in six different part-time work positions just in the past two years while he was a full-time student, shows John’s unfailing commitment to achieving his goals while developing himself as a person.
  And I see this same ideal—one that he wants to pass on to his future students—even in the careful wording of his career objective on his resume, where he speaks of helping students achieve their “academic, athletic, and social potential.”

  In short, it is clear to me that John Lerner is and will continue to be devoted to becoming the best kind of educator.
  His college background and work ethic remind me very much of my own, and I respect what he has done and will do as a teacher.
  Thus, I recommend him highly.

  *Letter 7*

  It is my sincere pleasure to write this letter recommending John Lerner for elementary school teaching positions.
  Mr.~Lerner recently participated in an innovative, field-based teacher preparation program that culminates in a year-long internship at a professional development school (http://www.ed.mu.edu/pds).
  The internship program is a central feature of an ongoing partnership between the Mythic Area School District and Mythic University.
  As part of this program, I served as one of Mr.~Lerner’s university supervisors and co-taught the concurrent science methods course, SCIED 458: Teaching Science in Elementary Schools, in which he and the other interns were enrolled during Fall 20xx.
  I also co-taught web-based portfolio workshops in which he participated.
  Because of my close and various associations with him, I feel qualified to comment on Mr.
  Lerner’s potential as an elementary educator.
  Mr.~Lerner will make a valuable addition to your staff—he is an outstanding candidate for elementary teaching positions.

  Within the professional development school context, Mr.~Lerner had the opportunity to work closely with his mentor teacher, school and university faculty, and other interns to explore issues of teaching and learning for understanding, and to consider connections between educational theory and practice.
  As part of the elementary science methods course, Mr.~Lerner collaborated with another intern to design and implement a series of lessons aimed at helping students investigate concepts associated with the principles of flight—thrust in particular.
  The development of his mini-unit required extensive background research, as well as the comprehensive assessment of students’ prior knowledge of the content.
  The learning experiences he crafted included a variety of opportunities for students to participate as young scientists (e.g., making predictions, gathering and recording observations/data, and developing evidence-based explanations).

  Throughout the year, Mr.~Lerner continued to develop a progressive approach to science teaching, and has become very proficient at planning and teaching developmentally appropriate, hands-on, investigationbased science lessons.
  For example, I recently observed him teaching a lesson on electricity in which students explored basic circuitry.
  Mr.~Lerner challenged his class to find multiple ways to make a bulb light using only one battery, one bulb, and one wire.
  Patterns in students’ discoveries were used to generate evidence-based explanations for how circuits work.
  Mr.~Lerner not only demonstrated a command of the subject matter, but also interacted with students and facilitated class discussion in a manner consistent with an experienced teacher.
  Students clearly respect him and respond to his proactive approaches to classroom management.
  It was truly a pleasure to observe this lesson!

  As part of his participation in the program, Mr.~Lerner had a number of opportunities to work with cutting edge applications of technology for supporting teaching and learning.
  For example, he used web authoring software to construct a web-based portfolio that included multimedia evidence from his courses and field experiences (e.g., scanned images, electronic lesson plans) to demonstrate his developing understandings and abilities associated with supporting children’s learning (http://www.personal.mu.edu/jlerner).
  Mr.~Lerner also integrated technology into the 4th-grade curriculum in a variety of ways, all intended to enhance student learning.
  His experiences with applications of technology should prove to be extremely valuable to any school or school district seeking to integrate computer technologies into its curriculum.

  In short, Mr.~Lerner is an excellent beginning teacher.
  Not only is he able to plan instruction that is engaging and developmentally appropriate, use a variety of assessment strategies to monitor and evaluate student learning, masterfully orchestrate classroom discussions, and effectively manage classroom routines and student behavior, but he also is a consummate professional.
  He is thoughtful, reflective, and committed to life-long learning and continued development as an educator.
  Mr.~Lerner is willing to share his ideas with colleagues and capitalize on opportunities to learn from others.
  For instance, he attended and presented his work with web-based portfolios at the Holmes Partnership Meeting (2004) in San Diego, CA, where the teacher education program in which he is enrolled was awarded the Nancy Zimpher Award for Best Partnership.
  As I noted at this meeting, he is poised and articulate as a presenter, and his contributions are worthy of accolades.

  In the context in which I have had the pleasure of working with Mr.~Lerner, he has demonstrated his thoughtfulness, leadership skills, collaborative abilities, willingness to take risks, and genuine compassion for children and their development.
  After evaluating his work, observing his performance in class, and supervising his teaching, I feel confident that Mr.~Lerner will make a significant contribution as an elementary educator.
  I give him my highest recommendation for teaching positions.

  If I can provide additional information to support Mr.~Lerner’s application for a position in your district, please contact me (555-123-4567 or jteacher\@mu.edu).

== Sample Graduate School Recommendation Letters

The three sample recommendation letters that follow are effective because they detail what makes the students stand out as exceptional and because they paint individual pictures of each student. Note how these excerpts, excerpted from each of the three letters, individualize and humanize the student:

#quote()[
  “I have been especially impressed by Janet’s determination and sparkle.”

  “I enthusiastically supported her application for the student position on the Mythic University Board of Trustees for the same reasons. She was the runner-up for that distinguished post, and Mythic University lost out on a true leader. But I believe her time is yet to come.”

  “In short, John is both scholarly and culturally entrenched, ambitious but not pretentious, self-deprecating yet confident, forthright but unassuming, delightfully irreverent yet appropriately respectful—a complex and whole human being.”
]

In addition, the writers of these three letters take advantage of many of the rhetorical strategies discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 of this manual: enhancing their own credibility, narrative technique, anecdotal evidence, recommending by citing others, and using active verbs and transitions.

Finally, a late paragraph in the last letter, at the prompting of the graduate scholarship application, even provides a few criticisms of the student. Because these criticisms are offered even-handedly and efficiently, I would argue that the letter has even more ethos, and it is noteworthy that the student still landed the desired scholarship.

#quote()[
  *Letter 8*

  To the Review Committee:

  I am pleased to write a letter of recommendation for Janet Lerner, an honors undergraduate student in our program.
  I have known Janet for more than two years.
  I came to know her very well when she was a student in my economic geography course.
  This summer, I hired her to work on an NSF-sponsored research project on Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change.
  And for the past six months, we have been developing a laboratory manual for my undergraduate course on the global economy.
  It is on the basis of this extensive experience that I write a letter of unequivocal support.

  Janet is an undergraduate student in the honors program at Mythic University.
  The honors program is designed to provide the educational experience of a small Ivy League college within a large public university.
  To be accepted, a student must have high SAT scores, be an excellent writer, and have very good high school grades.
  Students fulfill their course requirements by taking honors courses or by selecting a combination of classes with a heavy emphasis on graduate seminars and independent reading courses.
  Students must maintain a GPA of 3.2 or better in all courses in order to remain in the honors program.
  Janet has fulfilled this requirement admirably, maintaining a GPA of 3.8 or better throughout her career.
  Over the last few years, Janet designed a difficult curriculum for herself and has been very successful in combining graduate seminars and advanced undergraduate reading courses to fulfill her degree requirements.
  She is comfortable with herself and is well-recognized by her peer group.
  She, along with her peers from the honors program, will enter the nation’s best graduate schools next year in such varied fields as medicine, law, and other allied social sciences.
  She seeks to enroll in your graduate planning program.

  Janet is an enthusiastic, energetic, and exceptionally well-organized student.
  She writes beautifully, is widely read, and demonstrates good quantitative skills.
  In my economic geography course, she was the best student in the class.
  Her performance exceeded that of the incoming graduate students, including an NSF fellowship recipient.
  She always came to class prepared and was clearly far above her peers in understanding and appreciating the course material.

  I have been especially impressed by Janet’s determination and sparkle.
  Her work on the Model United Nations program (MUN) is an extremely large responsibility.
  The Model United Nations program convenes approximately 1000 high school students from around the world to simulate the experience of the UN.
  Janet has responsibility for designing and executing all phases of the simulation.
  She reviews the agendas of the UN over the previous year, and then collaboratively develops the student-run assembly agenda.
  To undertake this task successfully, she must understand international relations, international political economy, and world economic development issues.
  Her UN work has clearly influenced her interests and has been a very broadening experience for her.
  I am sure one explanation for why she has done so well in courses with me is that she understands the geography of the global economy from the simulated, yet very real-world perspective of the Model United Nations program.

  Concerning her potential as a teaching assistant, Janet has detailed experience in developing educational materials for courses.
  After many years of dissatisfaction with economic geography texts, I decided I would develop a laboratory manual for my introductory course.
  Based on Janet’s superior performance in the course I employed her to put the manual together.
  Although we talked at length about the project and I gave her broad outlines for each segment, nonetheless the lab manual is very much her creation.
  It is a five-assignment workbook built around a hypothetical scenario in which the student is a staff advisor to a program officer of the Ford Foundation.
  The assignments require that students complete a thorough analysis of a country, including an economic history, demographic analysis, trade assessment, and policy proposal.
  The manual is designed such that a student will be able to retrieve the necessary quantitative and cartographic information to complete the projects.
  Each assignment results in a memo based on a template Janet developed.
  Janet identified and tested all sources listed in the manual, and this project would not have reached fruition without Janet’s tireless efforts.

  I know from discussions with colleagues and graduate students in my department that we all think Janet is a very special student.
  I have enjoyed getting to know her as a person and find her surprisingly mature for her young age, quite capable of working entirely on her own in a self-directed manner.
  I am pleased that Janet is planning to enroll in graduate school starting this fall.
  I have no doubt that she has the skills, focus, and determination to successfully complete a master’s degree in a timely fashion.
  I also believe she will seek to complete a Ph.D.

  Janet is a rare find.
  She is well-trained, ambitious, and yet very open-minded and even self-effacing.
  I believe she will be successful wherever she ends up attending graduate school.
  She will be a dedicated student and a competent professional.

  I recommend her very highly and without reservation.

  *Letter 9*

  Janet Lerner is the best student I have this year, and I enthusiastically support her graduate application.
  She is highly intelligent, works well as a team member, and has demonstrated leadership potential.
  I enthusiastically supported her application for the student position on the Mythic University Board of Trustees for the same reasons.
  She was the runner-up for that distinguished post, and Mythic University lost out on a true leader.
  But I believe her time is yet to come.

  Janet has taken only one class with me, but we have maintained contact through discussions in my office and on the squash court.
  She is an excellent student—she received an A in my class and was among the top two or three students in all facets of the course.
  She writes well, she is very analytical, she is articulate, and she is prepared.
  But the A hardly did justice to her performance in my class.
  A major component of this class was a local government simulation.
  Students played a variety of roles and dealt with issues given to them in the simulation textbook and by me, as simulation leader.
  We spent over three weeks of class time on this activity, and it allowed me to evaluate my students’ strengths and weaknesses in some depth.
  Janet did not simply succeed in this simulation; rather, she owned it.
  The simulation included a zoning/development problem that is intended to be virtually intractable given the assigned roles and other simulation constraints.
  Janet beat the simulation.
  Her proposals were innovative, but within the confines of the simulation rules.
  She developed a solution, built the necessary coalition, developed creative compromises, and worked through to the proposal’s enactment.

  For her ingenuity, creativity, adherence to role, and enthusiasm, she received the class award for the most valuable simulation participant.
  But from my perspective her contribution went beyond this performance.
  Through the simulation Janet helped to set a tone, to take the simulation seriously and never say “it’s not real” as would many of the other students.
  She showed leadership within the simulation and within the class.

  Reflective now about Janet’s contribution to the class, I would add one more point about the simulation.
  Janet was also the most severe critic of its design and my operational decisions.
  She challenged me to keep the simulation realistic and to avoid contradictions and implausible developments.
  Janet is critical, perceptive, aggressive, but not overpowering.
  Her criticisms were honest and appropriate.

  Needless to say, I would love to teach a whole class full of Janet Lerners.
  She will make an outstanding graduate student.
  She has the intellectual capacity and she has the ambition.
  Based on what I have seen of her in the classroom and on the squash court, she also has the drive.
  And she will bring to graduate school a breadth rarely seen among graduate students: She double-majored in Political Science and Art History, a combination you do not often see.
  She speaks easily, and unusually perceptively, about politics, sports, the university community and academia in general, and anything else that comes up.

  She will be a rare catch for any graduate school, and I will watch her career develop with great interest and high expectations.

  *Letter 10*

  Perhaps the most memorable discussion I’ve ever had with a student about his decision to switch majors was three years ago.
  The student was a first-year Polymer Science and Engineering major on a scholarship, taking my introductory film class as an elective, and he told me he was considering a switch to Film.
  Assuming that this student was simply running into typical academic problems in first-year chemistry and physics courses, I asked how those courses were going.
  “Oh, I’m getting As in those,” he assured me with a calm wave of his hand.
  “But I long to study Film.” That student was John Lerner.

  Since that time, I’ve worked with John as a mentor on several of his papers for classes ranging from honors composition to film history and theory.
  In my seven-year career as a film instructor, no student has been more delightful to work with than has John.
  His papers are always creative, self-styled, skillful, and analytical.
  I quote from a creative essay he wrote during his first year of study, spoofing college philosophy and psychology classes by claiming that he got through them simply by peppering in quotations from Ingmar Bergman films: “When my philosophy professor asked me to explain human reactions to fear, I snapped, ‘In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God.’ I got an A in the course.” Later, John as a character in the essay discovers that he can arbitrarily quote Bergman films to advance his personal relationships as a college student as well, in that college is “a world full of fake intellectuals.”

  This is not to say that John’s work is too quirky or sardonic to thrive in the traditional academic arena.
  Another paper he wrote for a film class on Francois Truffaut’s La Nuit Américaine clearly demonstrates his facility with formal analysis.
  In this paper, John compares Truffaut’s life to his art (a staple of film criticism, certainly), but he does not trot out sophomoric insights—rather he analyzes crisply and complexly, embracing principles of paradox, juxtaposition, technique.
  One sees John’s gift for language and analytical focus from the first line of the paper: “The tap of his cane is heard before the first appearance of the boy on screen—almost an apparition of Antione Doinel—hustling down the sidewalk toward an imposing set of vertical bars.” In this paper and others I’ve reviewed with John, it’s clear that he has mastered the art of student paper writing, and he is just as comfortable with a formal analysis of film noir as he is with dropping in cultural references to vernacular English or Groucho Marx.

  I turn to these examples of John’s work so prominently not because I lack other kinds of evidence, but because as I read his work I am so impressed with the richness and diversity of his talents.
  More personally, I have had numerous opportunities to match my opinion of John’s work with that of his character.
  I’ve been intrigued and moved by conversations with him about his three adopted siblings.
  I’ve spoken with his peers about the particular sensibility that he brings to discussions in his classes, and I’ve spoken with his other professors about him, one of whom reports that he consistently “raises the tenor of class discussion greatly.” As a lover of film and a screenplay author, I have enjoyed many relaxed conversations with John about both film and script writing.
  As his writing mentor, I have discovered that he is willing to do complete retooling of a script that is off the mark, or that I need only briefly characterize a trend in his work for his jaunty mind to apply it to self-improvement.


  In short, John is both scholarly and culturally entrenched, ambitious but not pretentious, selfdeprecating yet confident, forthright but unassuming, delightfully irreverent yet appropriately respectful---a complex and whole human being.
  A recent discussion with him about his GPA crystallizes these traits: “I have a 3.99-something GPA,” he smiled.
  “I got an A- in a one-credit skiing class.
  I’m glad, really.
  Took the pressure off.”

  Given the substantial two-year stipend of the UCD Graduate Scholarship and your express request that recommenders voice their criticisms as well as their praise, I offer a few comments in that regard.
  Clearly, I mean to give John Lerner the highest recommendation, but not so subjectively that my opinion of him is varnished.
  I have known students with more concrete long-term goals than John has, I have worked with better writers, and for all his academic accomplishment, John is still a slightly withdrawn figure and at times the best in him needs to be coaxed forth.
  None of these issues, though, keep me from considering him to be among the best, most admired students I have known in my teaching career—a student on par with the award of a prestigious university scholarship.

  Because of John’s obvious writing and scholarly talent and his proven high level of interest in film, no student I have known would be more suited to thrive at the UCD School of Film, especially with a scholarship to fund his first two years.
  Please do give him your considered attention.
