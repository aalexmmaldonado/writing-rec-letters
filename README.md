As a new professor, the transition from soliciting letters of recommendation to authoring them was a significant adjustment.
While colleagues graciously offered to share their own examples, I found myself searching for a more concrete, "do this, not that" framework to guide my writing.
I eventually discovered [_Writing Recommendation Letters Online_](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/writingrecommendationlettersonline/) by [Joe Schall](https://roam.libraries.psu.edu/author/joe-schall), which offered the exact structural guidance I was looking for.
However, the original online text was difficult to navigate and showed its age through broken links, dated references, and some obsolete advice.

## tl;dr

### Administrative

- It is better to refuse to write a letter than to write a neutral or negative one that could unintentionally harm the student's chances.
- Confidential letters are generally viewed as more trustworthy and favorable by reviewers than non-confidential ones.
- You have an ethical duty to the profession and future employers to act as a gatekeeper and avoid recommending students for positions they are not qualified for.
- Ask students for a firm completion deadline, potentially earlier than the actual application due date if the student is submitting a package.

### Content

- Establish your credibility by clearly stating how long you have known the student and in what capacity, right at the beginning of the letter.
- Address academic shortcomings, such as inconsistent grades, directly and positively, provided you have discussed this with the student first.
- Use the specific language of the evaluation criteria found in the application forms to ground your topic sentences.
- Address academic shortcomings, such as inconsistent grades, directly and positively, provided you have discussed this permission with the student first.
- If you choose to include criticism to add credibility, keep it brief, place it late in the letter, and ensure it does not overshadow the endorsement.
- Tailor the content to the specific skills valued in the student's field, such as lab techniques for sciences or argumentation for law.
- Avoid including irrelevant details about the student's personal life, health, or your own beliefs that do not pertain to the selection process.
- Do not make statements that could be discriminatory regarding race, gender, age, politics, religion, or marital status unless invited explicitly by the application context.
- Knowing who else is writing letters for the student can help you provide a specific slant that complements other recommendations for a balanced picture.

### Style

- Replace generic compliments with specific narratives, examples, and evidence that provide a snapshot of the student's actual work and character.
- Use active verbs to describe accomplishments because they help present the student as energetic, respected, and mature.
- Do not use inflated rhetoric or hyperbolic praise without evidence, as unqualified glorification often makes a candidate seem less credible to selection committees.
- Adopt a tone that suggests warm familiarity, such as referring to the student by their first name rather than just their last name.
- Use transition words like consequently or clearly to lend economy to the writing and establish immediate focus.
- Ensure your persona humanizes both you and the student without becoming so idiosyncratic or clinical that it distracts the reader from the candidate.
- Use superlatives that reflect a thoughtful assessment of specific traits, such as describing a lab worker as diligent or fastidious rather than just generic praise.
- Define any terms specific to your institution, such as unique course titles or internal jargon, that an outside audience might misunderstand.

### Formatting

- Letters should generally be one to two pages long, as letters of three pages or more are often too lengthy for efficient review.
- Use your department or organization letterhead for the first page only and include your handwritten signature along with your typed name and title at the end.
- Include your full title and any other relevant titles, such as organization advisor, to connect you to the student and affirm your credibility.
- Avoid archaic greetings like Dear Sir or Madam and instead address a specific person or use a context-specific greeting like Dear Graduate School Selection Committee.
- Number and date any pages following the first one to ensure they can be identified if separated.
- Use standard publishing fonts like Times New Roman or Century in sizes between 10 and 12 points.
